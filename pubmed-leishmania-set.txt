AB  - INTRODUCTION: Various interventions including laser therapy, heat therapy, and 
      several drugs have been trialed in patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis. Due to the 
      lack of an evidence-based comparison of all these interventions, we carried out the 
      present network meta-analysis. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for 
      randomized clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of any interventions 
      in patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis. The proportion of patients with complete 
      cure was the primary outcome. The proportion of lesions cured at the end of 
      treatment, the proportion of lesions with minimal/no response to treatment, and 
      proportion of wounds with minimal/no change were the secondary outcomes. 
      Random-effects modeling was used for generating pooled estimates. Rankogram plot was 
      used for identifying the 'best intervention'. For interventions containing a 
      combination of treatments, backslash (/) has been used for depicting the same. 
      RESULTS: One-hundred and thirty-one studies were included. Intralesional meglumine, 
      topical paromomycin/gentamicin, topical paromomycin, parenteral sodium 
      stibogluconate, topical honey/intralesional meglumine, topical liposomal 
      amphotericin B, oral zinc sulphate, oral miltefosine, parenteral meglumine, heat 
      therapy, topical liposomal azithromycin, intralesional meglumine/silver dressing, 
      intralesional sodium stibogluconate, parenteral meglumine/intralesional meglumine, 
      oral allopurinol/parenteral meglumine, topical trichloroacetic acid/heat therapy, 
      oral zinc sulphate/oral ketoconazole, topical imiquimod/cryotherapy, intralesional 
      meglumine/cryotherapy, topical herbal extract of Z-HE, parenteral pentamidine, 
      topical trichloroacetic acid/intralesional meglumine, carbon-dioxide laser, topical 
      recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor/parenteral meglumine, 
      intralesional dapsone, carbon-dioxide laser/intralesional meglumine, moist wet 
      dressing with sodium hypochlorite, parenteral sodium stibogluconate/intralesional 
      recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, oral dapsone, 
      intralesional sodium stibogluconate/oral ketoconazole, intralesional sodium 
      stibogluconate/parenteral sodium stibogluconate and electrocautery/moist wet 
      dressing with sodium hypochlorite were observed with significantly greater 
      proportion of patients with complete cure compared to placebo/untreated controls. 
      Rankogram analysis revealed that parenteral pentamidine has the highest statistical 
      probability of being the best in the pool. CONCLUSION: We observed several 
      interventions to be effective for treating cutaneous leishmaniasis. However, greater 
      caution is required in interpreting the results as the estimates are likely to 
      change with the advent of results from future studies.

TI  - Laboratory Diagnosis of Cutaneous and Visceral Leishmaniasis: Current and Future 
      Methods.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms8111632 [doi]
LID - 1632
AB  - Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease with two main clinical forms: 
      cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. Diagnosis of leishmaniasis is still a 
      challenge, concerning the detection and correct identification of the species of the 
      parasite, mainly in endemic areas where the absence of appropriate resources is 
      still a problem. Most accessible methods for diagnosis, particularly in these areas, 
      do not include the identification of each one of more than 20 species responsible 
      for the disease. Here, we summarize the main methods used for the detection and 
      identification of leishmaniasis that can be performed by demonstration of the 
      parasite in biological samples from the patient through microscopic examination, by 
      in vitro culture or animal inoculation; by molecular methods through the detection 
      of parasite DNA; or by immunological methods through the detection of parasite 
      antigens that may be present in urine or through the detection of specific 
      antibodies against the parasite. Potential new methods that can be applied for 
      laboratory diagnosis of leishmaniasis are also discussed.

TI  - T cell lipid peroxidation induces ferroptosis and prevents immunity to infection.
PG  - 555-68

AB  - The selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) is a major scavenger of 
      phospholipid hydroperoxides. Although Gpx4 represents a key component of the 
      reactive oxygen species-scavenging network, its relevance in the immune system is 
      yet to be defined. Here, we investigated the importance of Gpx4 for physiological T 
      cell responses by using T cell-specific Gpx4-deficient mice. Our results revealed 
      that, despite normal thymic T cell development, CD8(+) T cells from T(ΔGpx4/ΔGpx4) 
      mice had an intrinsic defect in maintaining homeostatic balance in the periphery. 
      Moreover, both antigen-specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells lacking Gpx4 failed to 
      expand and to protect from acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and Leishmania 
      major parasite infections, which were rescued with diet supplementation of high 
      dosage of vitamin E. Notably, depletion of the Gpx4 gene in the memory phase of 
      viral infection did not affect T cell recall responses upon secondary infection. Ex 
      vivo, Gpx4-deficient T cells rapidly accumulated membrane lipid peroxides and 
      concomitantly underwent cell death driven by ferroptosis but not necroptosis. These 
      studies unveil an essential role of Gpx4 for T cell immunity.

TI  - Cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis in travellers and migrants: a 20-year 
      GeoSentinel Surveillance Network analysis.
LID - 10.1093/jtm/taz055 [doi]
LID - taz055
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) may be emerging among international 
      travellers and migrants. Limited data exist on mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) in 
      travellers. We describe the epidemiology of travel-associated CL and MCL among 
      international travellers and immigrants over a 20-year period through descriptive 
      analysis of GeoSentinel data. METHODS: Demographic and travel-related data on 
      returned international travellers diagnosed with CL or MCL at a GeoSentinel 
      Surveillance Network site between 1 September 1997 and 31 August 2017 were analysed. 
      RESULTS: A total of 955 returned travellers or migrants were diagnosed with 
      travel-acquired CL (n = 916) or MCL during the study period, of whom 10% (n = 97) 
      were migrants. For the 858 non-migrant travellers, common source countries were 
      Bolivia (n = 156, 18.2%) and Costa Rica (n = 97, 11.3%), while for migrants, they 
      were Syria (n = 34, 35%) and Afghanistan (n = 22, 22.7%). A total of 99 travellers 
      (10%) acquired their disease on trips of ≤ 2 weeks. Of 274 cases for which species 
      identification was available, Leishmania Viannia braziliensis was the most 
      well-represented strain (n = 117, 42.7%), followed by L. major (n = 40, 14.6%) and 
      L. V. panamensis (n = 38, 13.9%). Forty cases of MCL occurred, most commonly in 
      tourists (n = 29, 72.5%) and from Bolivia (n = 18, 45%). A total of 10% of MCL cases 
      were acquired in the Old World. CONCLUSIONS: Among GeoSentinel reporting sites, CL 
      is predominantly a disease of tourists travelling mostly to countries in Central and 
      South America such as Bolivia where risk of acquiring L. V. braziliensis and 
      subsequent MCL is high. The finding that some travellers acquired leishmaniasis on 
      trips of short duration challenges the common notion that CL is a disease of 
      prolonged travel. Migrants from areas of conflict and political instability, such as 
      Afghanistan and Syria, were well represented, suggesting that as mass migration of 
      refugees continues, CL will be increasingly encountered in intake countries.

TI  - A Cytokine Network Balance Influences the Fate of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis 
      Infection in a Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Hamster Model.

AB  - The golden hamster is a suitable model for studying cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) due 
      to Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis. Immunopathological mechanisms are well 
      established in the L. (L.) major-mouse model, in which IL-4 instructs a Th2 response 
      towards progressive infection. In the present study, we evaluated the natural 
      history of L. braziliensis infection from its first stages up to lesion 
      establishment, with the aim of identifying immunological parameters associated with 
      the disease outcome and parasitism fate. To this end, hamsters infected with 10(4), 
      10(5), or 10(6) promastigotes were monitored during the first hours (4h, 24h), early 
      (15 days, 30 days) and late (50 days) post-infection (pi) phases. Cytokines, iNOS 
      and arginase gene expression were quantified in the established lesions by reverse 
      transcription-quantitative PCR. Compared to the 10(5) or 10(6) groups, 10(4) animals 
      presented lower lesions sizes, less tissue damage, and lower IgG levels. Basal gene 
      expression in normal skin was high for TGF-β, and intermediary for TNF, IL-6, and 
      IL-4. At 4hpi, no cytokine induction was observed in the 10(4) group, while an 
      upregulation of IL-6, IL-10, and IL-4 was observed in the 10(6) group. At 15dpi, 
      lesion appearance was accompanied by an increased expression of all assessed 
      cytokines, markedly in the 10(5) and 10(6) groups. Upregulation of all investigated 
      cytokines was observed in the late phase, although less expressive in the 10(4) 
      group. IFN-γ was the depending variable influencing tissue damage, while IL-6 was 
      associated to parasite load. The network correlating gene expression and clinical 
      and laboratorial parameters indicated inoculum-independent associations at 15 and 
      30dpi. A strong positive network correlation was observed in the 10(4) group, but 
      not in the 10(5) or 10(6) groups. In conclusion, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TGF-β are 
      linked o L. braziliensis progression. However, a balanced cytokine network is the 
      key for an immune response able to reduce the ongoing infection and reduce 
      pathological damage.

      Infection: a Crucial Role for IL-32.

AB  - American tegumentary leishmaniasis is a vector-borne parasitic disease caused by 
      Leishmania protozoans. Innate immune cells undergo long-term functional 
      reprogramming in response to infection or Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination 
      via a process called trained immunity, conferring non-specific protection from 
      secondary infections. Here, we demonstrate that monocytes trained with the fungal 
      cell wall component β-glucan confer enhanced protection against infections caused by 
      Leishmania braziliensis through the enhanced production of proinflammatory 
      cytokines. Mechanistically, this augmented immunological response is dependent on 
      increased expression of interleukin 32 (IL-32). Studies performed using a humanized 
      IL-32 transgenic mouse highlight the clinical implications of these findings 
      in vivo. This study represents a definitive characterization of the role of IL-32γ 
      in the trained phenotype induced by β-glucan or BCG, the results of which improve 
      our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing trained immunity and 
      Leishmania infection control.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Progress with the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) has been 
      hampered by inconsistent methodologies used to assess treatment effects. A sizable 
      number of trials conducted over the years has generated only weak evidence backing 
      current treatment recommendations, as shown by systematic reviews on old-world and 
      new-world CL (OWCL and NWCL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a previously published 
      guidance paper on CL treatment trial methodology as the reference, consensus was 
      sought on key parameters including core eligibility and outcome measures, among OWCL 
      (7 countries, 10 trial sites) and NWCL (7 countries, 11 trial sites) during two 
      separate meetings. RESULTS: Findings and level of consensus within and between OWCL 
      and NWCL sites are presented and discussed. In addition, CL trial site 
      characteristics and capacities are summarized. CONCLUSIONS: The consensus reached 
      allows standardization of future clinical research across OWCL and NWCL sites. We 
      encourage CL researchers to adopt and adapt as required the proposed parameters and 
      outcomes in their future trials and provide feedback on their experience. The 
      expertise afforded between the two sets of clinical sites provides the basis for a 
      powerful consortium with potential for extensive, standardized assessment of 
      interventions for CL and faster approval of candidate treatments.

AB  - Leishmaniasis represents a major public health problem in the Eastern Mediterranean 
      Region (EMR) of the World Health Organization (WHO). Cutaneous and visceral 
      leishmaniasis are mainly seen in 14 of the 22 countries of the region. In several of 
      these countries outbreaks have an apparent tendency to occur at around 10-year 
      intervals. In 2008, some 100000 new cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis were reported. 
      Foci of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania major, occur in 
      Afghanistan, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Pakistan, Saudi 
      Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen. Anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis, 
      caused by L. tropica, occurs in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Morocco, Pakistan, Saudi 
      Arabia, Syria and Yemen. Anthroponotic visceral leishmaniasis, caused by L. 
      donovani, occurs mainly in Sudan and Somalia. Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis, 
      caused by L. infantum, occurs in most countries of the region. In order to address 
      the problem of leishmaniasis in the EMR, WHO is supporting ministries of health 
      through a strategic plan focusing on (a) training programme managers and health 
      workers on diagnosis and case management; (b) establishing a harmonized regional 
      surveillance system; (c) creating a regional network of experts; (d) promoting 
      political commitment of national governments.

TI  - Tegumentary leishmaniasis and coinfections other than HIV.
PG  - e0006125

LID - e0006125
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) is a disease of skin and/or mucosal 
      tissues caused by Leishmania parasites. TL patients may concurrently carry other 
      pathogens, which may influence the clinical outcome of TL. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: This review focuses on the frequency of TL coinfections in human 
      populations, interactions between Leishmania and other pathogens in animal models 
      and human subjects, and implications of TL coinfections for clinical practice. For 
      the purpose of this review, TL is defined as all forms of cutaneous (localised, 
      disseminated, or diffuse) and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Human immunodeficiency 
      virus (HIV) coinfection, superinfection with skin bacteria, and skin manifestations 
      of visceral leishmaniasis are not included. We searched MEDLINE and other databases 
      and included 73 records: 21 experimental studies in animals and 52 studies about 
      human subjects (mainly cross-sectional and case studies). Several reports describe 
      the frequency of Trypanosoma cruzi coinfection in TL patients in Argentina (about 
      41%) and the frequency of helminthiasis in TL patients in Brazil (15% to 88%). 
      Different hypotheses have been explored about mechanisms of interaction between 
      different microorganisms, but no clear answers emerge. Such interactions may involve 
      innate immunity coupled with regulatory networks that affect quality and quantity of 
      acquired immune responses. Diagnostic problems may occur when concurrent infections 
      cause similar lesions (e.g., TL and leprosy), when different pathogens are present 
      in the same lesions (e.g., Leishmania and Sporothrix schenckii), or when 
      similarities between phylogenetically close pathogens affect accuracy of diagnostic 
      tests (e.g., serology for leishmaniasis and Chagas disease). Some coinfections 
      (e.g., helminthiasis) appear to reduce the effectiveness of antileishmanial 
      treatment, and drug combinations may cause cumulative adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS 
      AND SIGNIFICANCE: In patients with TL, coinfection is frequent, it can lead to 
      diagnostic errors and delays, and it can influence the effectiveness and safety of 
      treatment. More research is needed to unravel how coinfections interfere with the 
      pathogenesis of TL.

AB  - Parasites of Leishmania genus have developed various strategies to overcome host 
      immune response favoring its infection and development toward leishmaniasis. With an 
      array of virulence factors, those parasites modify host macrophage signaling and 
      functions. Depending of the species involved, visceral or cutaneous leishmaniasis 
      will develop. Several years ago, Leishmania Viannia guyanensis that is naturally 
      infected with the endosymbiotic virus Leishmania RNA Virus 1 was found to cause a 
      particularly aggressive form of South-American mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. This 
      virus, when co-transmitted with the parasite was shown to strongly modulate RNA 
      sensors and NLRP3 inflammasome network that could explain in part the exacerbated 
      skin pathology caused by this particular parasite. In this review, we will be 
      discussing how this endosymbiotic virus-infected Leishmania in conjunction with 
      Leishmania exosomes partner together to manipulate host immune response in their 
      favor.

AB  - In this study, we used proteomics and biological network analysis to evaluate the 
      potential biological processes and components present in the identified proteins of 
      biopsies from cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) patients infected by Leishmania 
      braziliensis in comparison with normal skin. We identified 59 proteins differently 
      expressed in samples from infected and normal skin. Biological network analysis 
      employing identified proteins showed the presence of networks that may be involved 
      in the cell death mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. After immunohistochemical 
      analyses, the expression of caspase-9, caspase-3, and granzyme B was validated in 
      the tissue and positively correlated with the lesion size in CL patients. In 
      conclusion, this work identified differentially expressed proteins in the 
      inflammatory site of CL, revealed enhanced expression of caspase-9, and highlighted 
      mechanisms associated with the progression of tissue damage observed in lesions.

TI  - Surveillance of leishmaniasis cases from 15 European centres, 2014 to 2019: a 
      retrospective analysis.
LID - 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.4.2002028 [doi]
AB  - BackgroundSurveillance of human leishmaniasis in Europe is mostly limited to 
      country-specific information from autochthonous infections in the southern part. As 
      at the end of 2021, no integrated analysis has been performed for cases seen across 
      centres in different European countries.AimTo provide a broad perspective on 
      autochthonous and imported leishmaniasis cases in endemic and non-endemic countries 
      in Europe.MethodsWe retrospectively collected records from cutaneous, mucosal and 
      visceral leishmaniasis cases diagnosed in 15 centres between 2014 and 2019. Centres 
      were located in 11 countries: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, 
      Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Data on country 
      of infection, reason for travelling, infecting species, age and sex were 
      analysed.ResultsWe obtained diagnostic files from 1,142 cases, of which 76%, 21% and 
      3% had cutaneous, visceral, and mucosal disease, respectively. Of these, 68% were 
      men, and 32% women, with the median age of 37 years (range: 0-90) at diagnosis. 
      Visceral leishmaniasis was mainly acquired in Europe (88%; 167/190), while cutaneous 
      leishmaniasis was primarily imported from outside Europe (77%; 575/749). Sixty-two 
      percent of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases from outside Europe were from the Old 
      World, and 38% from the New World. Geographic species distribution largely confirmed 
      known epidemiology, with notable exceptions.ConclusionsOur study confirms previous 
      reports regarding geographic origin, species, and traveller subgroups importing 
      leishmaniasis into Europe. We demonstrate the importance of pooling species typing 
      data from many centres, even from areas where the aetiology is presumably known, to 
      monitor changing epidemiology.

AB  - Leishmaniasis is endemic and a mandatory reporting disease in Spain since 1982. 
      However, between 1996 and 2014, surveillance on public health was decentralized and 
      only some autonomous regions monitored the disease. The aim of this study is to 
      estimate the incidence of leishmaniasis and to evaluate the extent of underreporting 
      in Spain. A capture-recapture (CRC) study was conducted to calculate the incidence 
      of human leishmaniasis using reports from the National Surveillance Network (RENAVE) 
      and the Hospital Discharge Records of the National Health System (CMBD) for 2016 and 
      2017. During the study period, 802 cases were reported to RENAVE and there were 
      1,149 incident hospitalizations related to leishmaniasis. The estimated incidence 
      rates through the CRC study were 0.79 per 100,000 inhabitants for visceral 
      leishmaniasis (VL), 0.88 (cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL)) and 0.12 (mucocutaneous 
      leishmaniasis (MCL)) in 2016 and 0.86 (VL), 1.04 (CL) and 0.12 (MCL) in 2017. An 
      underreporting of 14.7-20.2% for VL and 50.4-55.1% for CL was found. The CRC method 
      has helped us to assess the sensitivity and representativeness of leishmaniasis 
      surveillance in Spain, being a useful tool to assess whether the generalization of 
      leishmaniasis surveillance throughout the Spanish territory achieves a reduction in 
      underreporting.

TI  - Immunopathology of leishmaniasis: an update.
PG  - 435-45
AB  - Leishmaniasis represents a severe, increasing, public health problem. The 
      perspective of its control is highly dependent on research progress, on therapeutic 
      manipulations of the immune system, and on vaccine development. There is a 
      correlation between the clinical outcome of Leishmania infection and the cytokine 
      response profile. While a protective immune response against Leishmania has been 
      clearly identified to be related to the influence of a type-1 response and IFN-gamma 
      production, the precise role of T helper (TH) 2 cytokines in non-healing infections 
      requires further exploration. IL-4 and IL-13 (TH2 cytokines) can promote disease 
      progression in cutaneous leishmaniasis, whereas IL-4 would appear to enhance 
      protective type-1 responses in visceral leishmaniasis. Thus, the TH1/TH2 paradigm of 
      resistance/susceptibility to intracellular parasites is probably an 
      oversimplification of a more complicated network of regulatory/counter regulatory 
      interactions. Moreover, the presence of antigen specific regulatory T cell subsets 
      may provide an environment that contributes to the balance between TH1 and TH2 
      cells. Finally, the involvement of CD8 positive T cells has been described, but the 
      modality of their function in this kind of infection has not been so far elucidated.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Outbreaks of human leishmaniasis are not very common in Spain, despite 
      being considered an endemic disease. In this study, a new outbreak in the Valencian 
      Community is presented. Its principal objective is to describe the 
      clinical-epidemiological characteristics and to present the main Public Health 
      measures established to contain the outbreak. METHODS: A case was defined as anyone 
      residing in the village of Tous (in Valencian Community), diagnosed with 
      leishmaniasis according to clinical and laboratory criteria, defined by the 
      Epidemiological Surveillance Network, and date of symptoms onset between 1 January 
      2012 and 31 December 2013. A descriptive analysis was performed on the 
      epidemiological variables collected. RESULTS: A total of 19 cases were reported from 
      the 28th week of 2012 to the 30th week of 2013. Adults were most affected by the 
      disease (73%). The most common clinical form was cutaneous leishmaniasis (89%). More 
      than three-quarters (79%) of cases were confirmed by PCR. Species typing was 
      performed on seven samples, with the parasite Leishmania infantum being identified. 
      Patient outcome was favourable after physical (31%), or pharmacological (69%) 
      treatment. Some kind of residual damage was observed in 37% of cases. Different 
      measures were applied, aimed at health professionals, and vector and reservoir 
      control, as well as general recommendations to the population for the containment of 
      the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: This cutaneous leishmaniasis outbreak confirms the 
      endemic nature and the high prevalence of the disease in the Mediterranean area. The 
      most commonly used treatment was intralesional meglumine antimoniate. A 
      comprehensive plan of action had to be developed in order to control the outbreak.

TI  - Design and characterization of high-affinity synthetic peptides as bioreceptors for 
      diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis.
PG  - 4545-4555
LID - 10.1007/s00216-021-03424-2 [doi]
AB  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is one of the illnesses caused by Leishmania parasite 
      infection, which can be asymptomatic or severe according to the infecting Leishmania 
      strain. CL is commonly diagnosed by directly detecting the parasites or their DNA in 
      tissue samples. New diagnostic methodologies target specific proteins (biomarkers) 
      secreted by the parasite during the infection process. However, specific 
      bioreceptors for the in vivo or in vitro detection of these novel biomarkers are 
      rather limited in terms of sensitivity and specificity. For this reason, we here 
      introduce three novel peptides as bioreceptors for the highly sensitive and 
      selective identification of acid phosphatase (sAP) and proteophosphoglycan (PPG), 
      which have a crucial role in leishmaniasis infection. These high-affinity peptides 
      have been designed from the conservative domains of the lectin family, holding the 
      ability to interact with the biological target and produce the same effect than the 
      original protein. The synthetic peptides have been characterized and the affinity 
      and kinetic constants for their interaction with the targets (sAP and PPG) have been 
      determined by a surface plasmon resonance biosensor. Values obtained for K(D) are in 
      the nanomolar range, which is comparable to high-affinity antibodies, with the 
      additional advantage of a high biochemical stability and simpler production. Pep2854 
      exhibited a high affinity for sAP (K(D) = 1.48 nM) while Pep2856 had a good affinity 
      for PPG (K(D) 1.76 nM). This study evidences that these peptidomimetics represent a 
      novel alternative tool to the use of high molecular weight proteins for 
      biorecognition in the diagnostic test and biosensor devices for CL.

TI  - Imported leishmaniasis in Germany 2001-2004: data of the SIMPID surveillance 
      network.
PG  - 471-6
AB  - Leishmaniasis is a rare, non-notifiable disease in Germany. Epidemiological and 
      clinical data, therefore, are scarce. Most infections seen in Germany are contracted 
      outside the country. The German surveillance network for imported infectious 
      diseases (Surveillance Importierter Infektionen in Deutschland, or SIPMID) recorded 
      42 cases of imported leishmaniasis (16 visceral, 23 cutaneous, and 3 mucocutaneous) 
      from January 2001 to June 2004. Although most infections were acquired in European 
      Mediterranean countries, the risk of infection was highest for travelers to Latin 
      America. HIV coinfection was observed significantly more often in patients with 
      visceral leishmaniasis than in patients with cutaneous/mucocutaneous leishmaniasis 
      (31 vs. 4%, p=0.02). The median time to a definitive diagnosis was 85 days in cases 
      of visceral leishmaniasis and 61 days in cases of cutaneous/mucocutaneous 
      leishmaniasis, reflecting the unfamiliarity of German physicians with leishmanial 
      infections. Visceral leishmaniasis was treated most frequently with amphotericin B, 
      whereas cutaneous/mucocutaneous leishmaniasis was treated with a variety of local 
      and systemic therapies. The findings presented here should serve to increase 
      awareness as well as improve clinical management of leishmaniasis in Germany.

TI  - [Epidemiology of leishmaniases in Portugal].
PG  - 859-64
AB  - Leishmaniases, caused by the intracellular protozoan Leishmania infantum, are an 
      endemic zoonosis in the Mediterranean basin. Dogs are considered the major host for 
      these parasites, and the main reservoir for human visceral infection. Parasites are 
      transmitted by the bite of phlebotomine sand flies, being Phlebotomus perniciosus 
      and P. ariasi the proven vectors in Portugal. The global climate changes associated 
      with a higher density and activity of sand flies during a larger period might 
      enhance the number of days favorable for transmission of parasites to humans and 
      animals with a concomitant increase of incidence. In our country, as in other 
      countries in the south of Europe, visceral leishmaniasis was initially a pediatric 
      disease but in the last years the number of cases in children has decreased with an 
      increase of infection in adults, normally associated with HIV/AIDS. Between 2000 and 
      2009, 173 new cases of human visceral leishmaniasis (66 in immunocompetent adults 
      and children and 107 in immunocompromised patients) were observed in the 
      Leishmaniasis Unit - IHMT. After the introduction of antiretroviral therapy HAART 
      for HIV, the number of co-infected cases reported from southern Europe has fallen 
      dramatically in all countries except in Portugal. In this country the number of 
      coinfection new cases did not decrease - neither the frequent relapses. Despite 
      cutaneous leishmaniasis being barely known in Portugal, it should not be considered 
      as a rare disease since about ten new cases per year are diagnosed. In addition, 
      canine leishmaniasis has increased with a prevalence rate up to 20% found in endemic 
      foci. In 2008 the Portuguese National Leishmaniasis Observatory was created. The 
      development of national and international epidemiological networks will help the 
      knowledge of leishmaniasis and will promote opportunities to advise health 
      authorities about the most effective measures for prevention and control of this 
      parasitosis. These networking initiatives and, importantly their integration, will, 
      hopefully, contribute towards a significant reduction of the incidence/prevalence of 
      human and canine visceral leishmaniasis.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the occurrence of Leishmania infection in bats in 
      urban and wild areas in an endemic municipality for visceral and cutaneous 
      leishmaniasis in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Between April 2014 to April 2015, 247 bats 
      were captured and classified into 26 species belonging to Phyllostomidae (90.7%), 
      Vespertilionidae (8.1%) and Molossidae (1.2%) families. Blood samples from 247 bats 
      were collected and submitted to nested-PCR, targeting the variable V7-V8 region of 
      the SSU rRNA gene, followed by sequencing of the PCR product. The overall infection 
      rate of Leishmania spp. in bats was 4.4%. Of the eleven bats infected, ten were 
      frugivorous bats: Artibeus planirostris (8/11), Artibeus lituratus (1/11) and 
      Artibeus cinereus (1/11) and one a nectarivorous bat (Glossophaga soricina). None of 
      the individuals exhibited macroscopic alterations in the skin, spleen or liver. 
      Phylogenetic analysis separated Leishmania species in clades corresponding to the 
      subgenera Viannia, Leishmania, and Mundinia, and supported that the isolates 
      characterized in the present study clustered closely with Leishmania (Viannia) sp., 
      Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum and Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis. Here we 
      report for the first time the bat Artibeus cinereus as a host of Leishmania 
      (Leishmania) amazonensis. In the study we found that the mean abundance of bats did 
      not differ in wild habitats and urban areas and that bat-parasite interactions were 
      similarly distributed in the two environments. On the other hand, further studies 
      should be conducted in more recent times to verify whether there have been changes 
      in these parameters.

TI  - Liposomal amphotericin B in travelers with cutaneous and muco-cutaneous 
      leishmaniasis: Not a panacea.
PG  - e0006094
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0006094 [doi]
LID - e0006094
AB  - BACKGROUND: Complex cutaneous and muco-cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL and MCL) often 
      requires systemic therapy. Liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) has a strong potential 
      for a solid clinical benefit in this indication. METHODS: We conducted a 
      retrospective analysis of data from a French centralized referral treatment program 
      and from the "LeishMan" European consortium database. All patients with 
      parasitologically proven CL or MCL who received at least one dose of L-AmB were 
      included. Positive outcome was based on ulcer closure as per recent WHO workshop 
      guidelines. RESULTS: From 2008 through 2016, 43 travelers returning from 18 
      countries (Old World n = 28; New World n = 15) were analyzed with a median follow-up 
      duration of 79 days [range 28-803]. Main clinical forms were: localized CL with one 
      or multiple lesions (n = 32; 74%) and MCL (n = 8; 19%). As per published criteria 19 
      of 41 patients (46%) were cured 90 days after one course of L-AmB. When the 
      following items -improvement before day 90 but no subsequent follow-up, delayed 
      healing (>3 months) and healing after a second course of L-AmB- were included in the 
      definition of cure, 27 of 43 patients (63%) had a positive outcome. Five patients 
      (MCL = 1; CL = 4) experienced a relapse after a median duration of 6 months [range 
      3-27] post treatment and 53% of patients (23/43) experienced at least one adverse 
      event including severe hypokalaemia and acute cardiac failure (one patient each). In 
      multivariate analysis, tegumentary infection with L. infantum was associated with 
      complete healing after L-AmB therapy (OR 5.8 IC 95% [1.03-32]) while infection with 
      other species had no impact on outcome. CONCLUSION: In conditions close to current 
      medical practice, the therapeutic window of L-AmB was narrow in travellers with CL 
      or MCL, with the possible exception of those infected with L. infantum. Strict 
      follow-up is warranted when using L-AmB in patients with mild disease.

TI  - Risk factors for antimony treatment failure in American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in 
      Northwestern-Argentina.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To date, there is no specific literature available on the determinants 
      for therapeutic failure (TF) with meglumine antimoniate (MA) in 
      Northwestern-Argentina. This study aimed to identify epidemiological, clinical, and 
      treatment-related factors that could be involved in TF. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: We performed a case-control study. Cases were represented by patients who 
      showed TF after administration of the first course of MA treatment, whereas, 
      controls were determined as patients who evolved towards healing after the first MA 
      cycle received. Crude Odds Ratios and their corresponding 90% confidence intervals 
      (CI) were calculated, and risk factors were then tested by multivariate analysis 
      using logistic binary regression. Three hundred and eighty-four patients with a 
      presumptive diagnosis of ACL were recruited, and 153 with a positive diagnosis were 
      selected. We included in the study 71 patients, who underwent specific treatment 
      with MA, presented complete data on response to treatment, and had a minimum 
      post-treatment follow-up of 6 months in cutaneous leishmaniasis, and 12 months in 
      mucosal leishmaniasis. Of these, 34 (47.9%) presented TF. In the initial analysis, 
      TF was significantly associated with the geographical area of disease acquisition (p 
      = 0.036), the presence of mucosal lesions (p = 0.042), the presence of concomitant 
      skin and mucosal lesions (p = 0.002), and lesion age ≥ 6 months (p = 0.018). Risk 
      factors influencing TF in the final multivariate model included the geographical 
      area where the disease was acquired (adjusted Odd Ratio 8.062; 95% CI 1.914-33.959; 
      p = 0.004), and lesion age ≥ 6 months (adjusted Odd Ratio 10.037; 95% CI 
      1.383-72.843; p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results of the present study 
      suggest the existence of some risk factors linked to TF in Northwestern-Argentina, 
      which deserve further investigation. Herein we recorded a high percentage of TF and 
      we described clinical and epidemiological characteristics associated with TF that 
      could be taken into account improving the clinical management of patients.

LID - 10.1093/cid/ciaa1206 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Control of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) relies on chemotherapy, yet gaps 
      in our understanding of the determinants of therapeutic outcome impede optimization 
      of antileishmanial drug regimens. Pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of antimicrobials 
      are based on the relationship between drug concentrations/exposure and microbial 
      kill. However, viable Leishmania persist in a high proportion of individuals despite 
      clinical resolution, indicating that determinants other than parasite clearance are 
      involved in drug efficacy. METHODS: In this study, the profiles of expression of 
      neutrophils, monocytes, Th1 and Th17 gene signatures were characterized in 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) during treatment with meglumine 
      antimoniate (MA) and clinical cure of human CL caused by Leishmania (Viannia). We 
      explored relationships of immune gene expression with plasma and intracellular 
      antimony (Sb) concentrations. RESULTS: Our findings show a rapid and orchestrated 
      modulation of gene expression networks upon exposure to MA. We report nonlinear 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships of Sb and gene expression 
      dynamics in PBMCs , concurring with a time lag in the detection of intracellular 
      drug concentrations and with PK evidence of intracellular Sb accumulation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results quantitatively portray the immune dynamics of therapeutic 
      healing, and provide the knowledge base for optimization of antimonial drug 
      treatments, guiding the selection and/or design of targeted drug delivery systems 
      and strategies for targeted immunomodulation.

AB  - Leishmaniasis is a zoonotic disease caused by intracellular protozoa of the 
      Leishmania genus that are spread and transmitted by sandflies. Natural infection and 
      clinical disease in domestic cats and dogs appear to be rare or perhaps largely 
      under-reported in endemic areas. However, previous reports on infected domestic 
      animals usually implicate the same Leishmania species that affect humans in tropical 
      and subtropical areas of the world suggesting a potential role for zoonotic 
      transmission. In the present study we assessed a representative sample of cats and 
      dogs from endemic urban / suburban areas of Lara state in central western Venezuela. 
      In both dogs and cats, cutaneous disease exhibits a spectrum of manifestations that 
      range from single papules or nodules, which may evolve into ulcerative, plaque-like 
      or scaly lesions. Cytochrome b (cyt b) PCR gene sequence analysis revealed L. 
      mexicana as the causative agent in all cases, including two human cases proceeding 
      from the same study area at the same time the study was carried out. In order to 
      improve our understanding on feline/canine infection with Leishmania mexicana, and 
      address potential zoonotic concerns it is necessary to characterize its enzootic 
      reservoirs and vectors as well as the possible anthropophilic players linking to the 
      peridomestic and domestic cycles.

AB  - Disseminated leishmaniasis is a severe and emerging form of American tegumentary 
      leishmaniasis. Disseminated leishmaniasis is defined by the presence of more than 10 
      polymorphic cutaneous lesions, distributed over more than two noncontiguous parts of 
      the body. Nasal mucosal involvement is observed in almost half of cases. 
      Disseminated leishmaniasis patients present with a decreased production of Th1 
      cytokines in the peripheral blood due to the attraction of leishmania- activated T 
      cells to the multiple cutaneous lesions. Disseminated leishmaniasis development is 
      poorly understood and is related to a complex network involving environmental, host 
      immune response, and parasite factors, in which L. braziliensis polymorphism plays 
      an important role. Disseminated leishmaniasis is a challenging disease to cure, 
      presenting a high failure rate of 75% to pentavalent antimony therapy. Despite its 
      importance and severity, this form of American tegumentary leishmaniasis has been 
      poorly studied and documented, deserving greater attention from professionals 
      working in endemic areas.

AB  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a main public health problem in Morocco, Algeria, 
      Tunisia and Iran, known as the MATI region. During the biennial meeting of Pasteur 
      Institutes of the MATI region in November 2016 in Tehran, a Leishmania panel formed 
      of scientists with different expertise in CL research from the MATI and Institut 
      Pasteur in Paris, proposed a new consortium to develop an integrative research 
      approach to better understand this disease. The proposed consortium synergizes three 
      complementary thematics on Leishmania genetics, host immune response, and vector 
      transmission. Moreover, assessing the social impact of CL with the aim to raise 
      awareness at both the national and international levels will be a major focus of 
      this consortium.

TI  - A novel diagnostic and prognostic approach for unresponsive patients with 
      anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis using artificial neural networks.

AB  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) imposes a major health burden throughout the tropical 
      and subtropical regions of the globe. Unresponsive cases are common phenomena 
      occurred upon exposure to the standard drugs. Therefore, rapid detection, prognosis 
      and classification of the disease are crucial for selecting the proper treatment 
      modality. Using machine learning (ML) techniques, this study aimed to detect 
      unresponsive cases of ACL, caused by Leishmania tropica, which will consequently be 
      used for a more effective treatment modality. This study was conducted as a 
      case-control setting. Patients were selected in a major ACL focus from both 
      unresponsive and responsive cases. Nine unique and relevant features of patients 
      with ACL were selected. To categorize the patients, different classifier models such 
      as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), multilayer perceptron 
      (MLP), learning vector quantization (LVQ) and multipass LVQ were applied and 
      compared for this supervised learning task. Comparison of the receiver operating 
      characteristic graphs (ROC) and confusion plots for the above models represented 
      that MLP was a fairly accurate prediction model to solve this problem. The overall 
      accuracy in terms of sensitivity, specificity and area under ROC curve (AUC) of MLP 
      classifier were 87.8%, 90.3%, 86% and 0.88%, respectively. Moreover, the duration of 
      the skin lesion was the most influential feature in MLP classifier, while gender was 
      the least. The present investigation demonstrated that MLP model could be utilized 
      for rapid detection, accurate prognosis and effective treatment of unresponsive 
      patients with ACL. The results showed that the major feature affecting the 
      responsiveness to treatments is the duration of the lesion. This novel approach is 
      unique and can be beneficial in developing diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic 
      measures against the disease. This attempt could be a preliminary step towards the 
      expansion of ML application in future directions.

TI  - Cytokines in leishmaniasis: a complex network of stimulatory and inhibitory 
      interactions.
PG  - 356-96
AB  - The work of immunologists, cell biologists and parasitologists in the field of 
      leishmaniasis has not only provided important insights into the immunopathogenesis 
      of this disease, but also yielded fundamental contributions to our understanding of 
      basic immunological phenomena and of host-parasite interactions. The ability of 
      recombinant interferon-gamma to induce the microbicidal activity of phagocytes and 
      the opposite effect of inhibitory cytokines was first demonstrated with 
      Leishmania-infected macrophages. The selective development of protective and 
      disease-mediating CD4+ T lymphocytes as well as their differential influence on the 
      course of the disease has been long investigated in the murine Leishmania major 
      model and now represents one of the best examples for the in vivo induction of type 
      1 versus type 2 T helper lymphocytes. At the same time, this model has also been 
      extensively used for immunization studies and cytokine therapy, which shed light on 
      the functions of cytokines in vivo as well as on the mechanism(s) of disease 
      resistance and susceptibility. In this review we will discuss the present picture of 
      the cytokine network in murine L. major infections.

AB  - Tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) is a parasitic disease that can result in wide 
      spectrum clinical manifestations. It is necessary to understand host and parasite 
      determinants of clinical outcomes to identify novel therapeutic targets. Previous 
      studies have indicated that the polyamine biosynthetic pathway is critical for 
      Leishmania growth and survival. Despite its importance, expression of the such 
      pathway has not been previously investigated in TL patients. We performed an 
      exploratory analysis employing Systems Biology tools to compare circulating 
      polyamines and amino acid concentration as well as polyamine pathway gene expression 
      in cutaneous lesions patients presenting with distinct TL disease presentations. 
      Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL) was associated with higher concentrations of 
      amino acids, polyamines and its substrate transporters than mucosal cutaneous 
      leishmaniasis or localized cutaneous leishmaniasis. In addition, the RNA expression 
      of polyamine-related genes of patients lesions from two separate cohorts 
      demonstrated that differential activation of this pathway is associated with 
      parasite loads and able to discriminate the clinical spectrum of TL. Taken together, 
      our findings highlight a new aspect of DCL immunopathogenesis indicating that the 
      polyamine pathway may be explored as a novel therapeutic target to control disease 
      burden.

TI  - TREM1 rs2234237 (Thr25Ser) Polymorphism in Patients with Cutaneous Leishmaniasis 
      Caused by Leishmania guyanensis: A Case-Control Study in the State of Amazonas, 
      Brazil.
LID - 10.3390/pathogens10040498 [doi]
LID - 498
AB  - BACKGROUND: Leishmaniasis is an infectious disease caused by Leishmania parasites. A 
      Th1 immune response is necessary in the acute phase to control the pathogen. The 
      triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-1 is a potent amplifier of 
      inflammation. Our aim is to identify whether the TREM1 variant rs2234237 A/T 
      (Thr25Ser) is associated with the disease development of cutaneous leishmaniasis 
      (CL) in Leishmania guyanensis-infected individuals. The effects of the rs2234237 
      genotypes on plasma cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, MCP-1 and TNF-α are also 
      investigated. METHODS: 838 patients with CL and 818 healthy controls (HCs) living in 
      the same endemic areas were genotyped by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction 
      Fragment Length Polymorphism. Plasma cytokines were assayed in 400 patients with CL 
      and 400 HCs using the BioPlex assay. RESULTS: The genotypes' and alleles' 
      frequencies were similar in both patients with CL (AA = 618, 74%; AT = 202, 24%; TT 
      = 18, 2%) and in HCs (AA = 580, 71%; AT = 220, 27%; TT = 18, 2%). Rs2234237 showed a 
      modest effect on plasma IL-10 that disappeared when correction of the p-value was 
      applied. Plasma IL-10 by rs2234237 genotypes were (mean ± SEM; AA = 2.91 pg/mL ± 
      0.14; AT = 2.35 pg/mL ± 0.12; TT = 3.14 pg/mL ± 0.56; p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: The 
      TREM1 rs2234237 (Thr25Ser) seems to have no influence on the susceptibility or 
      resistance to L. guyanensis infections.

AB  - We performed a systematic review of the literature published since 1900 about 
      leishmaniasis a neglected vector-borne disease, focused on environmental and social 
      risk factors for visceral (VL) and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) to better understand 
      their impact on the incidence of disease. The search terms were "leishmaniasis" AND 
      "risk factors" using Google Scholar, PudMed, and Scielo. We reviewed 177 articles, 
      95 studies for VL, 75 for CL, and 7 on both forms. We identified 14 categories of 
      risk factors which were divided into three groups: socioeconomic (7), environmental 
      (5), and climate (2) variables. Socioeconomic factors were also associated with 
      disease incidence in vulnerable human populations of arid and tropical developing 
      regions. Environmental and climate factors showed significant associations with the 
      incidence of VL and CL in all the studies that considered them. Proximity to natural 
      vegetation remnants increased disease risk in both the New and Old World while the 
      climate conditions favorable for disease transmission differed among regions. We 
      propose a common conceptual framework for both clinical forms that highlights 
      networks of interaction among risk factors. In both clinical forms, the interplay of 
      these factors played a major role in disease incidence. Although there are 
      similarities in environmental and socioeconomic conditions that mediate the 
      transmission cycle of tropical, arid, and Mediterranean regions, the behavior of 
      vector and reservoirs in each region is different. Special attention should be given 
      to the possibility of vector adaptation to urban environments in developing 
      countries where populations with low socioeconomic status are particularly 
      vulnerable to the disease.

TI  - Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis type 2 as probable etiological agent of canine 
      cutaneous leishmaniasis in Brazilian Amazon.

LID - e0216291
AB  - Canine cutaneous leishmaniasis (CCL) is a zoonosis of public health interest, and in 
      the Americas, Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis has been identified as the main 
      etiological agent. The present study sought to investigate Leishmania spp. infection 
      in domestic dogs from a rural area of the Xapuri municipality, Acre state, Brazilian 
      Amazonia. For this purpose, visits were carried out to domiciles where the human 
      cases of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) occurred, followed by the clinical 
      evaluation of the animals in search of clinical signs suggestive of CCL. Blood 
      samples were collected from 40 dogs, 13 of which had lesions suggestive of CCL, and 
      biopsies of these lesions were performed. The methods used were Neal, Novy, and 
      Nicolle's (NNN) medium cultures and direct parasitological examination. Further, to 
      detect and characterize Leishmania DNA some molecular techniques were performed such 
      as conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing targeting SSU rDNA 
      and ITS1, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and high resolution 
      melting (HRM) analysis targeting hsp70. The investigation revealed that the results 
      obtained from the parasitological methods were negative. In PCR by ITS1 and network 
      topology sequences, six strains from dogs, isolated from the Peruvian Andes, 
      appeared identical to Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis type 2 (99-100%). By other 
      molecular methods these samples turned out to be positive to Leishmania (Viannia) 
      sp.. The diagnosis of Leishmania in domestic dogs from Acre state showed a high 
      proportion of infected animals, and the occurrence of L. braziliensis type 2 in 
      Brazil for the first time. This new report suggests that L. braziliensis type 2 is 
      both trans- and cis-Andean. However, more studies are needed regarding the clinical 
      and diagnostic aspects of this species of Leishmania.

TI  - Fatty Acid Profiles of Leishmania major Derived from Human and Rodent Hosts in 
      Endemic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Areas of Tunisia and Algeria.
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11010092 [doi]
LID - 92
AB  - Leishmaniasis is a protozoal vector-borne disease that affects both humans and 
      animals. In the Mediterranean Basin, the primary reservoir hosts of Leishmania spp. 
      are mainly rodents and canids. Lipidomic approaches have allowed scientists to 
      establish Leishmania spp. lipid profiles for the identification of cell stage 
      specific biomarkers, drug mechanisms of action, and host immune response. Using an 
      in silico approach of global network interaction between genes involved in fatty 
      acid (FA) synthesis followed by the GC-MS approach, we were able to characterize the 
      fatty acid profiles of L. major derived from human and rodent hosts. Our results 
      revealed that the lipid profile of L. major showed similarities and differences with 
      those already reported for other Leishmania species. Phospholipids are the 
      predominant lipid class. FA composition of rodent parasites was characterized by a 
      lower abundance of the precursor C18:2(n-6). One of the rodent clones, which also 
      expressed the lowest lipid abundance in PL and TAG, was the least sensitive clone to 
      the miltefosine drug and has the lowest infection efficiency. Our findings suggest 
      that the lipid composition variation may explain the response of the parasite toward 
      treatment and their ability to infect their host.

AB  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a neglected tropical disease with a wide 
      distribution in the Americas. Brazil is an endemic country and present cases in all 
      states. This study aimed to describe the occurrence, the underlying clinical and 
      epidemiological factors, and the correlation of climatic variables with the 
      frequency of reported CL cases in the municipality of Caxias, state of Maranhão, 
      Brazil. This is a retrospective and descriptive epidemiological study based on data 
      extracted from the Brazilian Information System of Diseases Notification, from 2007 
      to 2017. Maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, and relative air humidity 
      data were provided by the Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology. A total of 
      201 reported autochthonous CL cases were analyzed. The predominance of cases was 
      observed in males (70.1%). The age range between 31 and 60 years old was the most 
      affected, with 96 cases (47.9%). Of the total number of registered cases, 38.8% of 
      the affected individuals were engaged in agriculture-related activities. The 
      georeferenced distribution revealed the heterogeneity of disease occurrence, with 
      cases concentrated in the Western and Southern regions of the municipality. An 
      association was detected between relative air humidity (monthly mean) and the number 
      of CL cases per month (p = 0.04). CL continues to be a concerning public health 
      issue in Caxias. In this context, there is a pressing need to strengthen measures of 
      prevention and control of the disease through the network of health services of the 
      municipality, considering local and regional particularities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the quantity and distribution of evidence from randomised 
      controlled trials for the treatment of the major neglected tropical diseases and to 
      identify gaps in the evidence with network analysis. DESIGN: Systematic review and 
      network analysis. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and 
      PubMed from inception to 31 August 2011. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled 
      trials that examined treatment of 16 neglected tropical diseases or complications 
      thereof published in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, or Dutch. 
      RESULTS: We identified 971 eligible randomised trials. Leishmaniasis (184 trials, 
      23,039 participants) and geohelminth infections; 160 trials, 46,887 participants) 
      were the most studied, while dracunculiasis (nine trials, 798 participants) and 
      Buruli ulcer (five trials, 337 participants) were least studied. Relative to its 
      global burden of disease, lymphatic filariasis had the fewest trials and 
      participants. Only 11% of trials were industry funded. Either a single trial or 
      trials with fewer than 100 participants comprised the randomised evidence for first 
      or second line treatments for Buruli ulcer, human African trypanosomiasis, American 
      trypanosomiasis, cysticercosis, rabies, echinococcosis, New World cutaneous 
      leishmaniasis, and each of the foodborne trematode infections. Among the 10 disease 
      categories with more than 40 trials, five lacked sufficient head to head comparisons 
      between first or second line treatments. CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable 
      variation in the amount of evidence from randomised controlled trials for each of 
      the 16 major neglected tropical diseases. Even in diseases with substantial 
      evidence, such as leishmaniasis and geohelminth infections, some recommended 
      treatments have limited supporting data and lack head to head comparisons.

LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiv548 [doi]
AB  - Unfettered inflammation is thought to play critical role in the development of 
      different clinical forms of tegumentary leishmaniasis. Eicosanoids are potent 
      mediators of inflammation and tightly associated with modulation of immune 
      responses. In this cross-sectional exploratory study, we addressed whether targets 
      from the eicosanoid biosynthetic pathway, assessed by multiplexed expression assays 
      in lesion biopsy and plasma specimens, could highlight a distinct biosignature in 
      patients with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) or localized cutaneous leishmaniasis 
      (LCL). Differences in immunopathogenesis between MCL and LCL may result from an 
      imbalance between prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which may serve as targets for 
      future host-directed therapies.

TI  - Variants of MIRNA146A rs2910164 and MIRNA499 rs3746444 are associated with the 
      development of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania guyanensis and with 
      plasma chemokine IL-8.
PG  - e0009795
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0009795 [doi]
LID - e0009795
AB  - Leishmania are intracellular protozoan parasites that cause a wide spectrum of 
      clinical manifestations in genetically susceptible individuals with an insufficient 
      or balanced Th1 immune response to eliminate the parasite. MiRNAs play important 
      regulatory role in numerous biological processes including essential cellular 
      functions. miR146-a acts as an inhibitor of interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 
      1 (IRAK1) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) 
      present in the toll-like receptors pathway while miR499a modulates TGF-β and TNF 
      signalling pathways. Here, we investigated whether MIRNA146A rs2910164 and MIRNA499 
      rs3746444 variants are associated with the development of L. guyanensis 
      (Lg)-cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). The variants MIR146A rs2910164 and MIR499A 
      rs3746444 were assessed in 850 patients with Lg-CL and 891 healthy controls by 
      polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). 
      Plasma cytokines were measured using the BioPlex assay. Carriers of rs2910164 CC 
      genotype have 30% higher odds of developing CL (ORadjage/sex = 1.3 [95%CI 0.9-1.8]; 
      Padjage/sex 0.14) compared to individuals with the genotype GG (ORadjage/sex = 0.77 
      [95%CI 0.56-1.0]; Padjage/sex 0.14) if exposed to Lg-infection. Heterozygous GC 
      individuals also showed lower odds of developing CL (ORadjage/sex = 0.77 [95%CI 
      0.5-1.1]; Padjage/sex 0.09). Homozygosity for the allele C is suggestive of an 
      association with the development of Lg-CL among exposed individuals to Lg-infection. 
      However, the odds of developing CL associated with the CC genotype was evident only 
      in male individuals (ORadjage = 1.3 [95% CI = 0.9-2.0]; Padjage = 0.06). Individuals 
      homozygous for the G allele tend to have higher plasma IL-8 and CCL5. Similarly, for 
      the MIR499A rs3746444, an association with the G allele was only observed among male 
      individuals (OR = 1.4 [1.0-1.9]; P = 0.009). In a dominant model, individuals with 
      the G allele (GG-GA) when compared to the AA genotype reveals that carriers of the G 
      allele have 40% elevated odds of developing Lg-CL (ORadjage = 1.4 [1.1-1.9]). 
      Individuals with the GG genotype have higher odds of developing Lg-CL (ORadjage/sex 
      = 2.0 [95%CI 0.83-5.0]; Padjage = 0.01. Individuals homozygous for the G allele have 
      higher plasma IL-8. Genetic combinations of both variants revealed that male 
      individuals exposed to Lg bearing three or four susceptible alleles have higher odds 
      of developing Lg-CL (OR = 2.3 [95% CI 1.0-4.7]; p = 0.017). Both MIR146A rs2910164 
      and MIR499A rs3746444 are associated with the development of Lg-CL and this 
      association is prevalent in male individuals.

AB  - Leishmania braziliensis infection frequently results in cutaneous leishmaniasis 
      (CL). An increase in incidence of drug-resistant CL leading to treatment failure has 
      been reported. Identification of reliable predictors of treatment outcomes is 
      necessary to optimize patient care. Here, we performed a prospective case-control 
      study in which plasma levels of cytokines and lipid mediators were assessed at 
      different time points during antileishmanial therapy in patients with CL from 
      Brazil. Multidimensional analyses were employed to describe a combination of 
      biomarkers able to predict and characterize treatment failure. We found a 
      biosignature influenced mainly by plasma levels of lipid mediators that accurately 
      predicted treatment failure. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of a publicly 
      available data set revealed that expression levels of genes related to lipid 
      metabolism measured in skin lesions could distinguish treatment outcomes in CL. 
      Thus, activation of pathways linked to lipid biosynthesis predicts treatment failure 
      in CL. The biomarkers identified may be further explored as therapeutic targets.

TI  - [Monitoring of canine leishmaniasis in northern Italy: an update from a scientific 
      network].
PG  - 193-7
AB  - Canine leishmaniasis (CanL) due to Leishmania infantum is a disease of great 
      veterinary importance and a serious public health problem. In humans, L. infantum 
      causes visceral (VL) and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and the distribution of VL 
      overlaps that of CanL. Currently, VL is considered by WHO as an emerging zoonosis in 
      southern Europe. The dog is the only domestic reservoir of the infection and 
      phlebotomine sandflies are the only proven vectors of leishmaniasis for dogs and 
      humans. CanL is endemic in Italy, particularly in central and southern regions, 
      including islands. Until 1983, all regions of northern Italy but Liguria and some 
      territories of Emilia Romagna were considered free from CanL. From early '90s new 
      stable foci of CanL have appeared, most of them located within classical endemic 
      areas including territories of Emilia Romagna, Tuscany, Umbria, Marche, and Abruzzi 
      regions. But the most relevant aspect, from an epidemiological point of view, has 
      been the appearance of stable CanL foci in northern Italy, namely in Veneto and 
      Piedmont regions. In these two foci, entomological surveys showed the presence of P. 
      perniciosus and of a second phlebotomine vector, P. neglectus, which may have played 
      a role in the CanL diffusion in some parts of northern Italy. Furthermore, in these 
      areas, autochthonous human VL cases have occurred. There is therefore a realistic 
      risk that CanL infection could rapidly spread through northern latitudes and a 
      surveillance activity is strongly needed. For this reason, in October 2002, thanks 
      to the collaboration and support of Intervet Italia, the network "LeishMap" was 
      created, with the main purpose of monitoring the spread of CanL and vectors in 
      northern Italy. LeishMap consists of scientific and sanitary institutions with 
      proven experience both in field surveys and diagnostic methodologies on CanL and 
      phlebotomine vector. It is organised in 4 Operational Units (OU), represented by 
      researchers of the Veterinary Faculties of the University of Bologna, Padua, Milan 
      and Turin, under the scientific coordination of the MIPI Department, ISS of Rome and 
      with the collaboration of private and public veterinarians operating in the regions 
      under study. During the first year of activity, each OU was involved in the 
      serological and entomological surveillance of several territories in the respective 
      regions, where recent autochthonous CanL cases were registered. The studies have 
      involved five regions, namely Valle D'Aosta, Piedmont, Lombardia, Veneto, 
      Trentino-Alto Adige and Emilia Romagna. In the Symposium 6 of this Congress we 
      report detailed results of a retrospective analysis of data concerning CanL and 
      vectors in northern Italy till 2002 and the preliminary results of 2003 on the 
      seroprevalence rates observed in foci studied and on the entomological surveys 
      carried out. In summary, the results outlined that already known foci of CanL are 
      expanding from the original sites. Several new foci have been identified and many 
      others are at high risk of evolving toward a stable endemicity. P. perniciosus has 
      been found in all but one the suspected new foci. In Emilia Romagna region P. 
      perfiliewi was identified in 2 areas and in one was the only species present. The 
      occurrence of P. neglectus was confirmed in three regions, Veneto, Lombardia and 
      Piedmont. In conclusion, from the 2002-2003 LeishMap activities it appears that 
      further monitoring activities are necessary to identify new endemic foci of CanL, 
      this representing the prerequisite for the implementation of programs for 
      leishmaniasis control in northern Italy.

      leishmaniasis.

AB  - Leishmaniasis is the second largest parasitic killer disease caused by the protozoan 
      parasite Leishmania, transmitted by the bite of sand flies. It's endemic in the 
      eastern India with 165.4 million populations at risk with the current drug regimen. 
      Three forms of leishmaniasis exist in which cutaneous is the most common form caused 
      by Leishmania major. Trypanothione Reductase (TryR), a flavoprotein oxidoreductase, 
      unique to thiol redox system, is considered as a potential target for chemotherapy 
      for trypanosomatids infection. It is involved in the NADPH dependent reduction of 
      Trypanothione disulphide to Trypanothione. Similarly, is Tryparedoxin Peroxidase 
      (Txnpx), for detoxification of peroxides, an event pivotal for survival of 
      Leishmania in two disparate biological environment. Fe-S plays a major role in 
      regulating redox balance. To check for the closeness between human homologs of these 
      proteins, we have carried the molecular clock analysis followed by molecular 
      modeling of 3D structure of this protein, enabling us to design and test the novel 
      drug like molecules. Molecular clock analysis suggests that human homologs of TryR 
      i.e. Glutathione Reductase and Txnpx respectively are highly diverged in 
      phylogenetic tree, thus, they serve as good candidates for chemotherapy of 
      leishmaniasis. Furthermore, we have done the homology modeling of TryR using 
      template of same protein from Leishmania infantum (PDB ID: 2JK6). This was done 
      using Modeller 9.18 and the resultant models were validated. To inhibit this target, 
      molecular docking was done with various screened inhibitors in which we found 
      Taxifolin acts as common inhibitors for both TryR and Txnpx. We constructed the 
      protein-protein interaction network for the proteins that are involved in the redox 
      metabolism from various Interaction databases and the network was statistically 
      analysed.

TI  - Ecological niche modelling for predicting the risk of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the 
      Neotropical moist forest biome.
PG  - e0007629
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0007629 [doi]
LID - e0007629
AB  - A major challenge of eco-epidemiology is to determine which factors promote the 
      transmission of infectious diseases and to establish risk maps that can be used by 
      public health authorities. The geographic predictions resulting from ecological 
      niche modelling have been widely used for modelling the future dispersion of vectors 
      based on the occurrence records and the potential prevalence of the disease. The 
      establishment of risk maps for disease systems with complex cycles such as cutaneous 
      leishmaniasis (CL) can be very challenging due to the many inference networks 
      between large sets of host and vector species, with considerable heterogeneity in 
      disease patterns in space and time. One novelty in the present study is the use of 
      human CL cases to predict the risk of leishmaniasis occurrence in response to 
      anthropogenic, climatic and environmental factors at two different scales, in the 
      Neotropical moist forest biome (Amazonian basin and surrounding forest ecosystems) 
      and in the surrounding region of French Guiana. With a consistent data set never 
      used before and a conceptual and methodological framework for interpreting data 
      cases, we obtained risk maps with high statistical support. The predominantly 
      identified human CL risk areas are those where the human impact on the environment 
      is significant, associated with less contributory climatic and ecological factors. 
      For both models this study highlights the importance of considering the 
      anthropogenic drivers for disease risk assessment in human, although CL is mainly 
      linked to the sylvatic and peri-urban cycle in Meso and South America.

      in northeast of Iran.
PG  - 282-286
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Phlebotomine sandflies (Diptera: Psychodidae) transmit 
      several important zoonotic diseases to humans and leishmaniasis is one of them. Two 
      types of leishmaniasis, viz. visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and cutaneous leishmaniasis 
      (CL) are endemic in Iran. The main vector of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis 
      (ACL) is Phlebotomus sergenti. The aim of the present study was to determine the 
      susceptibility status of wild strain of P. sergenti to different imagicides of DDT, 
      bendiocarb and permethrin at the median lethal time, LT50 level. METHODS: Sandflies 
      were collected from selected village in North Khorasan Province, northeast of Iran 
      from indoors using CDC light-traps. Susceptibility test was carried out against DDT 
      (4%), bendiocarb (0.1%) and permethrin (0.75%) for all the females according to WHO 
      method, and mortality was calculated. Species identification was carried out using 
      the morphological keys. Data were analysed using probit regression analysis to 
      determine the LT50 and LT90 values. RESULTS: In total, 851 female P. sergenti 
      sandflies were tested. LT50 values to DDT (4%), Bendiocarb (0.1%) and permethrin 
      (0.75%) were 15.4, 19.2 and 6.3 min respectively. The values for LT90 were 51.1, 
      47.4 and 18.6 min respectively. The mortality rates for 1 h exposure time to DDT, 
      bendiocarb and permethrin were 89.8 ± 1.4; 93.6 ± 1.4; and 95.6 ± 1.7%, 
      respectively. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The suscesptibility studies revealed 
      development of resistance against DDT (4%) in the wild strain of P. sergenti 
      population. Monitoring and mapping of insecticide resistance in the region is 
      recommended for vector control.

AB  - The first autochthonous cases of cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis in the 
      Americas were described in 1909, but visceral leishmaniasis only erupted as a public 
      health problem in the region in 1934. Today Brazil is the country with the most 
      cases of American tegumentary leishmaniasis, and alongside India has the highest 
      incidence of visceral leishmaniasis. Knowledge production and efforts to control 
      these diseases have mobilized health professionals, government agencies and 
      institutions, international agencies, and rural and urban populations. My research 
      addresses the exchange and cooperation networks they established, and uncertainties 
      and controversial aspects when notable changes were made in the approach to the New 
      World leishmaniases.

TI  - Population Genetics of Phlebotomus papatasi from Endemic and Nonendemic Areas for 
      Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Morocco, as Revealed by Cytochrome Oxidase Gene 
      Subunit I Sequencing.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms8071010 [doi]
LID - 1010
AB  - Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) caused by Leishmania major Yakimoff & Shokhor 
      and transmitted by Phlebotomus papatasi (Scopoli) is a public health concern in 
      Morocco. The disease is endemic mainly in pre-Saharan regions on the southern slope 
      of the High Atlas Mountains. The northern slope of the High Atlas Mountains and the 
      arid plains of central Morocco remain non-endemic and are currently considered high 
      risk for ZCL. Here we investigate and compare the population genetic structure of P. 
      papatasi populations sampled in various habitats in historical foci and non-endemic 
      ZCL areas. A fragment of the mtDNA cytochrome oxidase I (CO1) gene was amplified and 
      sequenced in 59 individuals from 10 P. papatasi populations. Haplotype diversity was 
      probed, a median-joining network was generated (F(ST)) and molecular variance 
      (AMOVA) were analyzed. Overall, we identified 28 haplotypes with 32 distinct 
      segregating sites, of which seven are parsimony informative. The rate of private 
      haplotypes was high; 20 haplotypes (71.4%) are private ones and exclusive to a 
      single population. The phylogenetic tree and the network reconstructed highlight a 
      genetic structuration of these populations in two well defined groups: Ouarzazate 
      (or endemic areas) and Non-Ouarzazate (or nonendemic areas). These groups are 
      separated by the High Atlas Mountains. Overall, our study highlights differences in 
      terms of population genetics between ZCL endemic and non-endemic areas. To what 
      extent such differences would impact the transmission of L. major by natural P. 
      papatasi population remains to be investigated.

AB  - Localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL) is a chronic disease characterized by 
      ulcerated skin lesion(s) and uncontrolled inflammation. The mechanisms underlying 
      the pathogenesis of LCL are not completely understood, and little is known about 
      posttranscriptional regulation during LCL. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small 
      RNAs that regulate gene expression and can be implicated in the pathogenesis of LCL. 
      We investigated the involvement of miRNAs and their targets genes in human LCL using 
      publicly available transcriptome data sets followed by ex vivo validation. Initial 
      analysis highlighted that miRNA expression is altered during LCL, as patients 
      clustered separately from controls. Joint analysis identified eight high confidence 
      miRNAs that had altered expression (-1.5 ≤ fold change ≥ 1.5; p < 0.05) between 
      cutaneous ulcers and uninfected skin. We found that the expression of miR-193b and 
      miR-671 are greatly associated with their target genes, CD40 and TNFR, indicating 
      the important role of these miRNAs in the expression of genes related to the 
      inflammatory response observed in LCL. In addition, network analysis revealed that 
      miR-193b, miR-671, and TREM1 correlate only in patients who show faster wound 
      healing (up to 59 days) and not in patients who require longer cure times (more than 
      60 days). Given that these miRNAs are associated with control of inflammation and 
      healing time, our findings reveal that they might influence the pathogenesis and 
      prognosis of LCL.

AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis is a deadly illness caused by Leishmania donovani that 
      provokes liver and spleen inflammation and tissue destruction. In cutaneous 
      leishmaniasis, the protein of L. major, named inhibitor of serine peptidases (ISP) 
      2, inactivates neutrophil elastase (NE) present at the macrophage surface, resulting 
      in blockade of TLR4 activation, prevention of TNF-α and IFN-β production, and 
      parasite survival. We report poor intracellular growth of L. donovani in macrophages 
      from knockout mice for NE (ela(-/-)), TLR4, or TLR2. NE and TLR4 colocalized with 
      the parasite in the parasitophorous vacuole. Parasite load in the liver and spleen 
      of ela(-/-) mice were reduced and accompanied by increased NO and decreased TGF-β 
      production. Expression of ISP2 was not detected in L. donovani, and a transgenic 
      line constitutively expressing ISP2, displayed poor intracellular growth in 
      macrophages and decreased burden in mice. Infected ela(-/-) macrophages displayed 
      significantly lower IFN-β mRNA than background mice macrophages, and the 
      intracellular growth was fully restored by exogenous IFN-β. We propose that L. 
      donovani utilizes the host NE-TLR machinery to induce IFN-β necessary for parasite 
      survival and growth during early infection. Low or absent expression of parasite 
      ISP2 in L. donovani is necessary to preserve the activation of the NE-TLR 
      pathway.-Dias, B. T., Dias-Teixeira, K. L., Godinho, J. P., Faria, M. S.,

AB  - Haplotype and gene network analyses were performed on mitochondrial cytochrome 
      oxidase I and cytochrome b gene sequences of Lutzomyia (Lu.) ayacuchensis 
      populations from Andean areas of Ecuador and southern Peru where the sand fly 
      species transmit Leishmania (Leishmania) mexicana and Leishmania (Viannia) 
      peruviana, respectively, and populations from the northern Peruvian Andes, for which 
      transmission of Leishmania by Lu. ayacuchensis has not been reported. The haplotype 
      analyses showed higher intrapopulation genetic divergence in northern Peruvian Andes 
      populations and less divergence in the southern Peru and Ecuador populations, 
      suggesting that a population bottleneck occurred in the latter populations, but not 
      in former ones. Importantly, both haplotype and phylogenetic analyses showed that 
      populations from Ecuador consisted of clearly distinct clusters from southern Peru, 
      and the two populations were separated from those of northern Peru.

LID - 2283
AB  - Leishmania braziliensis infection causes skin ulcers, typically found in localized 
      cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL). This tissue pathology associates with different 
      modalities of cell necrosis, which are subverted by the parasite as a survival 
      strategy. Herein we examined the participation of necroptosis, a specific form of 
      programmed necrosis, in LCL lesions and found reduced RIPK3 and PGAM5 gene 
      expression compared to normal skin. Assays using infected macrophages demonstrated 
      that the parasite deactivates both RIPK3 and MLKL expression and that these 
      molecules are important to control the intracellular L. braziliensis replication. 
      Thus, LCL-related necroptosis may be targeted to control infection and disease 
      immunopathology.

      multi-centre study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus 
      Leishmania. Clinical manifestations of leishmaniasis include cutaneous leishmaniasis 
      (CL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL). About 90% of cases occur in the tropics or 
      subtropics but the disease is also endemic in the Mediterranean area. No systematic 
      analysis on leishmaniasis in travellers visiting endemic areas in Europe is 
      available. METHODS: Within the European travel medicine network EuroTravNet, we 
      performed a retrospective analysis in travellers who acquired leishmaniasis within 
      Europe diagnosed between 2000 and 2012. RESULTS: Forty cases of leishmaniasis (30 CL 
      and 10 VL) were identified; the majority were acquired in Spain (n = 20, 50%), Malta 
      and Italy (each n = 7, 18%). Median age was 48 years (range 1-79). Three of eight 
      (37.5%) of the VL patients were on immunosuppressive therapy. The most frequent 
      reason for travel was tourism (83%). Median duration of travel for patients with CL 
      and VL was 2 weeks with ranges of 1-21 weeks in CL and 1-67 weeks in VL, 
      respectively (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Health professionals should include 
      leishmaniasis in the differential diagnosis in patients returning from southern 
      Europe - including short-term travellers - with typical skin lesions or systemic 
      alterations like fever, hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia.

TI  - Resolvin D1 drives establishment of Leishmania amazonensis infection.
PG  - 46363
LID - 10.1038/srep46363 [doi]
LID - 46363
AB  - Previous studies have indicated that the balance between different eicosanoids 
      reflect the intensity of the inflammatory profile in patients with tegumentary 
      leishmaniasis. More recently, pro-resolution lipid mediators have been shown to play 
      critical roles in dampening pathological inflammatory processes to reestablish 
      homeostasis in a diverse range of experimental settings. Among these lipid mediator, 
      resolvins from D series have been described as potent anti-inflammatory and 
      immunomodulatory mediators, and its activities include inhibition of leukocyte 
      chemotaxis and blockage production of proinflammatory cytokines, while increasing 
      the expression of regulatory mediators. Whether resolvins play significant roles in 
      establishment and persistence of Leishmania infection is currently unknown. We 
      addressed this question in the current study by assessing circulating levels of 
      D-series resolvins in tegumentary leishmaniasis patients presenting with localized 
      or diffuse disease. We found heightened expression of resolvin D1 in diffuse 
      cutaneous leishmaniasis which was correlated with expression profile of biomarkers 
      associated with disease pathogenesis. Additional in vitro experiments using primary 
      human macrophages indicated that resolvin D1 may promote intracellular Leishmania 
      amazonensis replication through a mechanism associated with induction of heme 
      oxygenase-1. These results suggest that targeting resolvin D1 could serve as 
      potential strategy for host directed therapy in diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis.

TI  - Clinical diversity and treatment results in Tegumentary Leishmaniasis: A European 
      clinical report in 459 patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is frequent in travellers and can involve 
      oro-nasal mucosae. Clinical presentation impacts therapeutic management. 
      METHODOLOGY: Demographic and clinical data from 459 travellers infected in 47 
      different countries were collected by members of the European LeishMan consortium. 
      The infecting Leishmania species was identified in 198 patients. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 
      Compared to Old World CL, New World CL was more frequently ulcerative (75% vs 47%), 
      larger (3 vs 2cm), less frequently facial (17% vs 38%) and less frequently 
      associated with mucosal involvement (2.7% vs 5.3%). Patients with mucosal lesions 
      were older (58 vs 30 years) and more frequently immunocompromised (37% vs 3.5%) 
      compared to patients with only skin lesions. Young adults infected in Latin America 
      with L. braziliensis or L. guyanensis complex typically had an ulcer of the lower 
      limbs with mucosal involvement in 5.8% of cases. Typically, infections with L. major 
      and L. tropica acquired in Africa or the Middle East were not associated with 
      mucosal lesions, while infections with L. infantum, acquired in Southern Europe 
      resulted in slowly evolving facial lesions with mucosal involvement in 22% of cases. 
      Local or systemic treatments were used in patients with different clinical 
      presentations but resulted in similarly high cure rates (89% vs 86%). 
      CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: CL acquired in L. infantum-endemic European and 
      Mediterranean areas displays unexpected high rates of mucosal involvement comparable 
      to those of CL acquired in Latin America, especially in immunocompromised patients. 
      When used as per recommendations, local therapy is associated with high cure rates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Leishmaniasis is one of the most important infectious diseases affecting 
      the Colombian National Army due to the high number of reported cases and exposure 
      throughout military operations in endemic areas. The main aim of this study was to 
      estimate the geographical distribution along with the genetic diversity and 
      treatment outcome of Leishmania species in Colombian military personnel. METHODS: 
      Skin lesion samples by smear and aspirate were collected in 136 patients having 
      parasitological cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) diagnosis. DNA was extracted, the 
      nuclear marker heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) was amplified by PCR and sequenced. 
      Leishmania species were identified by BLASTn. The geo-spatial distribution of the 
      identified parasites was determined according to the possible site of infection. 
      Gene tree was constructed by maximum likelihood (ML), diversity indices (π, h) were 
      estimated and haplotype network was constructed under the Templeton-Crandall-Sing 
      algorithm in order to determine the geographic relationships of the genetic variants 
      of Leishmania species circulating in Colombian military population. RESULTS: The 
      species were identified in 77.94% of the samples, with a predominance of L. 
      braziliensis (65.09%), followed by L. panamensis (31.13%), L. naiffi by the first 
      time reported in Colombia in two patients (1.89%) as well as L. lindenbergi in a 
      single patient (0.945%) with possible infection in the municipality of Miraflores, 
      Guaviare and L. infantum in a single patient (0.945%) notified with CL in the 
      municipality of Tumaco, Nariño. The phylogenetic analysis was consistent according 
      to bootstrap, showing four strongly differentiated clades. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      geo-spatial distribution suggested that L. braziliensis has a greater abundance, 
      while L. panamensis has a greater dispersion. The phylogenetic relationships of 
      Leishmania species in Colombian military personnel was estimated with the 
      confirmation of two new species circulating without prior report in the country and 
      a species with no background for CL in the Colombian army. A substantial genetic 
      diversity of Leishmania braziliensis was defined. This study contributes through the 
      understanding of the molecular epidemiology to the CL transmission in Colombia.

      context.
PG  - 502

AB  - BACKGROUND: In South America, cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and visceral 
      leishmaniasis (VL) are emerging diseases, expanding in the border area of Argentina, 
      Brazil and Paraguay. Outbreaks of CL were reported since the 1990s, with Nyssomyia 
      whitmani as the main vector in this region. Regarding VL, urban reports started in 
      2010 with Lutzomyia longipalpis as the main vector. The aim of this study was to 
      evaluate environmental determinants related to the main vectors of leishmaniasis, to 
      contribute to the prevention and control response to the emergence of VL and CL in 
      the Argentina-Brazil-Paraguay border region. METHODS: The cross-sectional survey 
      includes two cities and two close rural areas in the Argentinean Northeast Region, 
      between November 2014 and January 2015, with a total of 95 sampling sites. REDILA-BL 
      traps were set for three consecutive nights, and a total of 68 meso- and microscale 
      environmental and landscape characteristics were surveyed. The association between 
      vector abundance with different variables was evaluated using a generalized linear 
      model with zero-inflated negative binomial distribution. We analyzed females for 
      detection of Leishmania DNA. RESULTS: The analysis for Lu. longipalpis indicates an 
      excess of absences when the mean NDWI around the sites were higher. The abundance of 
      Lu. longipalpis at mesoscale level was higher when more urban services were present, 
      and when blood sources such as chickens or dogs at the microscale level were 
      present. For Ny. whitmani, no variable was found to be associated with the absences, 
      while its abundance increased in association with the following variables: 
      percentage of tree cover, presence of garbage collection service, hosted people and, 
      at microscale, the presence of poultry. Leshmania infantum DNA was detected in 2/49 
      (4%) Lu. longipalpis. CONCLUSIONS: The abundance of both species is influenced by 
      variables at different scales, their influence probably has a hierarchy and they are 
      acting on different aspects of the biology of these vectors. The urban spatial 
      segregation of Lu. longipalpis and the peri-urban and rural segregation of N. 
      whitmani increase the risk of VL and CL. The selection of the better variables for 
      each scale will allow the design of appropriate control strategies depending on 
      species.

TI  - Gene Expression Profile of High IFN-γ Producers Stimulated with Leishmania

AB  - BACKGROUND: The initial response to Leishmania parasites is essential in determining 
      disease development or resistance. In vitro, a divergent response to Leishmania, 
      characterized by high or low IFN-γ production has been described as a potential tool 
      to predict both vaccine response and disease susceptibility in vivo. METHODS AND 
      FINDINGS: We identified uninfected and healthy individuals that were shown to be 
      either high- or low IFN-γ producers (HPs and LPs, respectively) following 
      stimulation of peripheral blood cells with Leishmania braziliensis. Following 
      stimulation, RNA was processed for gene expression analysis using immune gene 
      arrays. Both HPs and LPs were shown to upregulate the expression of CXCL10, IFI27, 
      IL6 and LTA. Genes expressed in HPs only (CCL7, IL8, IFI44L and IL1B) were 
      associated with pathways related to IL17 and TREM 1 signaling. In LPs, uniquely 
      expressed genes (for example IL9, IFI44, IFIT1 and IL2RA) were associated with 
      pathways related to pattern recognition receptors and interferon signaling. We then 
      investigated whether the unique gene expression profiles described here could be 
      recapitulated in vivo, in individuals with active Cutaneous Leishmaniasis or with 
      subclinical infection. Indeed, using a set of six genes (TLR2, JAK2, IFI27, IFIT1, 
      IRF1 and IL6) modulated in HPs and LPs, we could successfully discriminate these two 
      clinical groups. Finally, we demonstrate that these six genes are significantly 
      overexpressed in CL lesions. CONCLUSION: Upon interrogation of the peripheral 
      response of naive individuals with diverging IFN-γ production to L. braziliensis, we 
      identified differences in the innate response to the parasite that are recapitulated 
      in vivo and that discriminate CL patients from individuals presenting a subclinical 
      infection.

TI  - Quantification of Leishmania (Viannia) Kinetoplast DNA in Ulcers of Cutaneous 
      Leishmaniasis Reveals Inter-site and Inter-sampling Variability in Parasite Load.
PG  - e0003936
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003936 [doi]
LID - e0003936
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a skin disease caused by the protozoan 
      parasite Leishmania. Few studies have assessed the influence of the sample 
      collection site within the ulcer and the sampling method on the sensitivity of 
      parasitological and molecular diagnostic techniques for CL. Sensitivity of the 
      technique can be dependent upon the load and distribution of Leishmania amastigotes 
      in the lesion. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We applied a quantitative real-time 
      PCR (qPCR) assay for Leishmania (Viannia) minicircle kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) 
      detection and parasite load quantification in biopsy and scraping samples obtained 
      from 3 sites within each ulcer (border, base, and center) as well as in cytology 
      brush specimens taken from the ulcer base and center. A total of 248 lesion samples 
      from 31 patients with laboratory confirmed CL of recent onset (≤3 months) were 
      evaluated. The kDNA-qPCR detected Leishmania DNA in 97.6% (242/248) of the examined 
      samples. Median parasite loads were significantly higher in the ulcer base and 
      center than in the border in biopsies (P<0.0001) and scrapings (P = 0.0002). There 
      was no significant difference in parasite load between the ulcer base and center (P 
      = 0.80, 0.43, and 0.07 for biopsy, scraping, and cytology brush specimens, 
      respectively). The parasite load varied significantly by sampling method: in the 
      ulcer base and center, the descending order for the parasite load levels in samples 
      was: cytology brushes, scrapings, and biopsies (P<0.0001); in the ulcer border, 
      scrapings had higher parasite load than biopsies (P<0.0001). There was no difference 
      in parasite load according to L. braziliensis and L. peruviana infections (P = 0.4). 
      CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest an uneven distribution of Leishmania 
      amastigotes in acute CL ulcers, with higher parasite loads in the ulcer base and 
      center, which has implications for bedside collection of diagnostic specimens. The 
      use of scrapings and cytology brushes is recommended instead of the more invasive 
      biopsy.

AB  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis is the most common form of leishmaniasis, caused by 
      Leishmania major and is spread by the bite of a sandfly .This species infects the 
      macrophages and dendritic cells Due to multi-drug resistance, there is a need for a 
      new therapeutic technique. Recently, a novel molecular motor of Leishmania, Myosin 
      XXI, was classified and characterized. In addition, the drug resistance in this 
      organism has been linked with the overexpression of ABC transporters. Systems 
      biology aims to study the simulation and modeling of natural biological systems 
      whereas synthetic biology deals with building novel and artificial biological parts 
      and devices  Together they have contributed enormously to drug discovery, vaccine 
      design and development, infectious disease detection and diagnostics. Synthetic 
      genetic regulatory networks with desired properties, like toggling and oscillation 
      have been proposed to be useful for gene therapy. In this work, a nanocircuit with 
      coupled bistable switch - repressilator  has been designed, simulated in the 
      presence and absence of inducer, in silico, using Tinker Cell. When inducer is 
      added, the circuit has been shown to produce reporter at high levels, which will 
      impair the activity of Myosin XXI and ABC transporters. Validation of the circuit 
      was also performed using GRENITS and BoolNet. The influence of inducer on the 
      working of the circuit, i.e., the type of gene expression, response time delay, the 
      steady states formed by the circuit and the quasipotential landscape of the circuit 
      were performed. It was found that the addition of inducer reduced the response time 
      delay in the graded type of gene expression and removed the multiple intermediate 
      attractors of the circuit. Thus, the inducer increased the probability of the 
      circuit to be present in the dominant stable state with high reporter concentration 
      and hence the designed nanocircuit may be used for the treatment of leishmaniasis .

AB  - In this study, we have analysed the phenotypic features of innate/adaptive immunity 
      of patients with localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL), categorized according to 
      their clinical/laboratorial status, including number of lesion (L1; L2–4), days of 
      illness duration (≤60;>60) and positivity in the Montenegro skin test (MT−;MT+). Our 
      findings highlighted a range of phenotypic features observed in patients with LCL 
      (↑%HLA-DR+ neutrophils; ↑CD8+ HLA-DR+/CD4+ HLA-DR+ T cell ratio; ↑HLA-DR in B 
      lymphocytes, ↑%CD23+ neutrophils, monocytes and B cells; ↑α-Leishmania IgG and 
      ↑serum NO₂⁻ + NO₃⁻). Selective changes were observed in L1 (↑%HLA-DR+ neutrophils, 
      ↑CD8+ HLA-DR+/CD4+ HLA-DR+ T cell ratio and ↑serum NO₂⁻ + NO₃⁻) as compared to L2–4 
      (↑%CD5− B cells; ↑CD23+ B cells and ↑α-Leishmania IgG). Whilst ≤60 presented a mixed 
      profile of innate/adaptive immunity (↓%CD28+ neutrophils and ↑%CD4+ T cells), >60 
      showed a well-known leishmanicidal events (↑CD8+ T cells; ↑serum NO₂⁻ + NO₃⁻ and 
      ↑α-Leishmania IgG). MT+ patients showed increased putative leishmanicidal capacity 
      (↑%HLA-DR+ neutrophils; ↑%CD23+ monocytes; ↑CD8+ HLA-DR+/CD4+ HLA-DR+ T cell ratio 
      and ↑ serum NO₂⁻ + NO₃⁻). Overall, a range of immunological biomarkers illustrates 
      the complex immunological network associated with distinct clinical/laboratorial 
      features of LCL with applicability in clinical studies.

AB  - We evaluated performance characteristics of five diagnostic methods for cutaneous 
      leishmaniasis. Patients who came to the Leishmania Clinic of Hospital Nacional 
      Cayetano Heredia in Lima, Peru, were enrolled in the study. Lesion smears, culture, 
      microculture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and leishmanin skin test (LST) were 
      performed. A total of 145 patients with 202 lesions were enrolled: 114 patients with 
      161 lesions fulfilled criteria for cutaneous leishmaniasis. Sensitivity and 
      specificity were 57.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 50.2-65.4%) and 100.0% for 
      culture, 78.3% (95% CI = 71.9-84.7%) and 100.0% for microculture, 71.4% (95% CI = 
      64.4-78.4%) and 100.0% for smears, 78.2% (95% CI = 70.6-85.8%) and 77.4% (95% CI = 
      62.7-92.1%) for LST, and 96.9% (95% CI = 94.2-99.6%) and 65.9% (95% CI = 51.4-80.4%) 
      for PCR. PCR was more sensitive than the other assays (P < 0.001). Sensitivities of 
      culture, smears, and LST varied by lesion duration and appearance. PCR offers 
      performance advantages over other assays, irrespective of patient age, sex, lesion 
      duration, or appearance. That clinical factors influence performance of 
      non-molecular assays offers clinicians a patient-focused approach to diagnostic test 
      selection.

AB  - Leishmaniasis has been considered as emerging and re-emerging disease, and its 
      increasing global incidence has raised concerns. The great clinical diversity of the 
      disease is mainly determined by the species. In several American countries, 
      tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) is associated with both Leishmania amazonensis and L. 
      braziliensis, while visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is associated with L. (L.) infantum. 
      The major molecules that determine the most diverse biological variations are 
      proteins. In the present study, through a DIGE approach, we identified 
      differentially abundant proteins among the species mentioned above. We observed a 
      variety of proteins with differential abundance among the studied species; and the 
      biological networks predicted for each species showed that many of these proteins 
      interacted with each other. The prominent proteins included the heat shock proteins 
      (HSPs) and the protein network involved in oxide reduction process in L. 
      amazonensis, the protein network of ribosomes in L. braziliensis, and the proteins 
      involved in energy metabolism in L. infantum. The important proteins, as revealed by 
      the PPI network results, enrichment categories, and exclusive proteins analysis, 
      were arginase, HSPs, and trypanothione reductase in L. amazonensis; enolase, 
      peroxidoxin, and tryparedoxin1 in L. braziliensis; and succinyl-CoA ligase [GDP 
      -forming] beta-chain and transaldolase in L. infantum.

AB  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is an infectious disease that commonly caused by 
      Leishmania (L.) major and L.tropica. Recently there has been a growing interest in 
      proteomics analysis on Leishmania for drug target discovery. Therefore, we aimed to 
      distinguish proteins which might be characteristic for each of the species from 
      those shared by both to the detection of drug targets, which may become helpful for 
      designing new drugs for CL. To identify differences in protein profiles of L. major 
      and L. tropica, we conducted a Sequential window acquisition of all theoretical 
      fragment ion spectra mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS) analysis. Totally 67 
      differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) (fold change> 2 and p < 0.05) were 
      identified between species. Of these, 42 and 25 proteins were up-regulated in L. 
      major and L. tropica, respectively. Several enriched GO terms were identified via 
      biological process of up-regulated proteins. Furthermore, the small molecule 
      metabolic process and translation were detected as significant biological processes 
      for up-regulated proteins in L. major, while translation was identified for L. 
      tropica. Also, KEGG analysis has revealed glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and translation 
      as the top pathways in the proteins up-regulated in L. major and L. tropica, 
      respectively. Finally glycosomal malate dehydrogenase was identified as putative 
      drug target using network and homology analyses. The DEPs between the species are 
      essential in host-pathogen interactions and parasite survival in the macrophage. 
      Furthermore, L. major and L. tropica possibly uses different pathogenicity 
      mechanisms that leads to anthroponotic or zoonotic CL. Our results may help in the 
      drug discovery and chemotherapeutic interventions.

TI  - Gene Expression in Leishmania Is Regulated Predominantly by Gene Dosage.
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01393-17 [doi]
LID - e01393-17
AB  - Leishmania tropica, a unicellular eukaryotic parasite present in North and East 
      Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent, has been linked to large 
      outbreaks of cutaneous leishmaniasis in displaced populations in Iraq, Jordan, and 
      Syria. Here, we report the genome sequence of this pathogen and 7,863 identified 
      protein-coding genes, and we show that the majority of clinical isolates possess 
      high levels of allelic diversity, genetic admixture, heterozygosity, and extensive 
      aneuploidy. By utilizing paired genome-wide high-throughput DNA sequencing (DNA-seq) 
      with RNA-seq, we found that gene dosage, at the level of individual genes or 
      chromosomal "somy" (a general term covering disomy, trisomy, tetrasomy, etc.), 
      accounted for greater than 85% of total gene expression variation in genes with a 
      2-fold or greater change in expression. High gene copy number variation (CNV) among 
      membrane-bound transporters, a class of proteins previously implicated in drug 
      resistance, was found for the most highly differentially expressed genes. Our 
      results suggest that gene dosage is an adaptive trait that confers phenotypic 
      plasticity among natural Leishmania populations by rapid down- or upregulation of 
      transporter proteins to limit the effects of environmental stresses, such as drug 
      selection.IMPORTANCELeishmania is a genus of unicellular eukaryotic parasites that 
      is responsible for a spectrum of human diseases that range from cutaneous 
      leishmaniasis (CL) and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) to life-threatening 
      visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Developmental and strain-specific gene expression is 
      largely thought to be due to mRNA message stability or posttranscriptional 
      regulatory networks for this species, whose genome is organized into polycistronic 
      gene clusters in the absence of promoter-mediated regulation of transcription 
      initiation of nuclear genes. Genetic hybridization has been demonstrated to yield 
      dramatic structural genomic variation, but whether such changes in gene dosage 
      impact gene expression has not been formally investigated. Here we show that the 
      predominant mechanism determining transcript abundance differences (>85%) in 
      Leishmania tropica is that of gene dosage at the level of individual genes or 
      chromosomal somy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Esfahan Province is considered as one of the main focus of zoonotic 
      cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) in Iran. Recently, ZCL distribution is expanding 
      through this province leading to report of new cases in non-endemic areas. In the 
      current study epidemiological aspects of ZCL has been investigated in Naein County 
      in Esfahan Province. METHODS: Adult sand flies were collected from beginning to the 
      end of their seasonal activity. Rodents were caught by Sherman live traps once a 
      month for one year. To active case detection, a hundred households in each selected 
      village were visited in November and December 2016. Nested-PCR was employed to 
      detect Leishmania parasite in the vector, reservoir and human. RESULTS: Totally 1562 
      sand flies including Phlebotomus sergenti, Phlebotomus papatasi, Sergentomyia 
      sintoni and Sergentomyia mervinae were collected and identified. No Leishmania 
      infection was detected in the collected sand flies. All of the 30 collected rodents 
      were identified as Rhombomys opimus, and of these 3.3% and 26.7% were infected by 
      Leishmania major using microscopic and molecular technique respectively. Totally, 
      914 individuals were investigated and the ulcer and scar rates of ZCL calculated to 
      be at 1.1 and 15.3 per 1000 population, respectively. Molecular results confirmed L. 
      major infection in human and reservoir samples. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that ZCL 
      is established in the area in low endemicity, and it is extrapolated the disease 
      will not be a serious increasing health problem in the near future in this region.

TI  - Hypoxia-Inducible Factor Signaling in Macrophages Promotes Lymphangiogenesis in 
      Leishmania major Infection.

AB  - Vascular remodeling is a phenomenon seen in the cutaneous lesions formed during 
      infection with Leishmania parasites. Within the lesion, Leishmania major infection 
      leads to the infiltration of inflammatory cells, including macrophages, and is 
      associated with hypoxic conditions and lymphangiogenesis in the local site. This 
      low-oxygen environment is concomitant with the expression of hypoxic inducible 
      factors (HIFs), which initiate the expression of vascular endothelial growth 
      factor-A (VEGF-A) in macrophages during the infection. Here, we found that 
      macrophage hypoxia is elevated in the skin, and the HIF target Vegfa is 
      preferentially expressed at the site of infection. Further, transcripts indicative 
      of both HIF-1α and HIF-2α activation were increased at the site of infection. Given 
      that HIF mediates VEGF-A and that VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signaling induces 
      lymphangiogenesis, we wanted to investigate the link between myeloid HIF activation 
      and lymphangiogenesis during L. major infection. We show that myeloid aryl 
      hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)/HIF/VEGF-A signaling promotes 
      lymphangiogenesis (the generation of newly formed vessels within the local lymphatic 
      network), which helps resolve the lesion by draining away inflammatory cells and 
      fluid. Concomitant with impaired lymphangiogenesis, we find the deletion of myeloid 
      ARNT/HIF signaling leads to an exacerbated inflammatory response associated with a 
      heightened CD4(+) Th1 immune response following L. major infection. Altogether, our 
      data suggest that VEGF-A-mediated lymphangiogenesis occurs through myeloid ARNT/HIF 
      activation following Leishmania major infection and this process is critical in 
      limiting immunopathology.

TI  - Leishmaniases and HIV/AIDS co-infections: review of common features and management 
      experiences.
PG  - 37-49
AB  - The visceral and the different spectrum of cutaneous leishmaniases have been 
      incriminated to be among the opportunistic infections co-existing with HIV/AIDS. In 
      co-infections, leishmaniases surface in high prevalence, present frequently 
      atypically, pose difficulties to be detected by routine diagnostic tests, most often 
      result in an unfavorable response to treatment, frequent relapses and in premature 
      deaths. Such presentations and management difficulties shall be highlighted in this 
      review. To extract information on the scope of manifestations and responses to 
      management, literature was surveyed utilizing the Pub Med electronic literature 
      search. In due course, pertinent characteristics surfacing in HIV/AIDS and 
      leishmaniasis co-infections comprising of clinical presentations and parasitological 
      and serological findings were tracked. Investigation options, management approaches, 
      outcomes of various treatment regimen and other intervention strategies were as well 
      explored. Visceral leishmaniasis and HIV-1 are both associated with a depression of 
      T cell response and similar disturbances of cytokine networks. The appearance of HIV 
      has led to numerous atypical clinical manifestations of leishmaniasis among 
      immunocompromised patients to include, recurrences, lingual, cervical, esophageal, 
      mucocutaneous and presentations in other unusual sites. The common clinical 
      presentations of the disease might not always be present being masked by other 
      associated opportunistic infections. Spleen aspiration is more sensitive in 
      immuno-competent visceral visceral leishmaniasis suspects, however, bone marrow 
      aspirate remains the safest and the most frequently employed diagnostic technique in 
      co-infected patients. Several species of Leishmania are incriminated in affecting 
      HIV infected subjects, including formerly unknown zymodemes. In spite of the high 
      number of reported cases of HIV-related VL, the treatment of choice, the best dosage 
      and the duration of therapy appear not to be properly established. The pentavalent 
      antimonials still remain the first line of therapy for co-infected cases. 
      Amphotericin-B, especially the liposome formulation (Ambisome) was found to be 
      relatively less toxic and more potent compared to pentamidine. A broad spectrum of 
      other drugs have as well been used. The widespread use of HAART are envisaged to 
      contribute to a progressive decrease in the morbidity and mortality of 
      HIV-associated visceral leishmaniasis. There is no effective chemoprophylaxis or 
      immuno-prophylaxis to prevent leishmanial infection. In the events of co-infections 
      with HIV/AIDS, the need for policy provisions to control both diseases needs to be 
      underlined. It is as well of a paramount importance that factors influencing 
      co-infection are understood for effective treatment against leishmaniasis in 
      co-infected patients. The need for improved diagnostic tests and new more effective 
      and less toxic drugs is also apparent.

AB  - Introduction: French Guiana is an overseas region of France on the north coast of 
      South America and is mostly covered by tropical rainforest. Most human settlements 
      are located along the coast while some settlements are scattered across the 
      hinterland. In 2001, the French public health service launched a telemedicine pilot 
      project between the main hospital in Cayenne and remote health centers in French 
      Guiana to tackle healthcare access inequalities. The aim of the present study was to 
      review dermatology cases of the French Guiana telemedicine network to assess the use 
      of telemedicine in dermatology, in order to evaluate its usefulness and propose ways 
      to improve the system. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on all 
      dermatology cases referred between July 2015 and December 2016 through the French 
      Guiana platform. The Model for Assessment of Telemedicine (MAST) methodology was 
      used as recommended by the European Union. Results: A total of 254 cases were 
      reviewed by dermatologists at Cayenne hospital over the 18-month study period, with 
      a mean of 14 cases per month. All the 16 peripheral health centers used the 
      telemedicine service during the study. In most cases (202/254, 80%), specialists 
      provided a single diagnosis to the referrers. Infectious diseases represented the 
      main reasons for requests (92/202, 46%) including 32% (29/92) of neglected tropical 
      diseases like leprosy and cutaneous leishmaniasis. A total of 39% (100/258) 
      peripheral centers answered the end-users' survey, and more than 85% found the 
      answer delay was fast, the service useful and with an educational benefit. Overall, 
      the accuracy of the diagnosis increased with the quality of the pictures provided, 
      though the latter was good in only 60% (75/125) of the cases. Most patients for whom 
      a teleconsultations has been required (234/254, 92%) have been managed in the 
      peripheral health centers, while referring the patient to Cayenne was necessary for 
      only 20/254 (8%). Conclusion: The telemedicine system in French Guiana appears to be 
      an interesting solution to the lack of specialists and allowed a better access to 
      specialized dermatology care for people living in the remote areas of this region.

TI  - Travel-acquired infections in Canada: CanTravNet 2011-2012.
PG  - 313-325
AB  - BACKGROUND: Important gaps remain in our knowledge of the infectious diseases people 
      acquire while travelling and the impact of pathogens imported by Canadian 
      travellers. OBJECTIVE: To provide a surveillance update of illness in a cohort of 
      returned Canadian travellers and new immigrants. METHODS: Data on returning Canadian 
      travellers and new immigrants presenting to a CanTravNet site between September 2011 
      and September 2012 were extracted and analyzed by destination, presenting symptoms, 
      common and emerging infectious diseases and disease severity. RESULTS: During the 
      study period, 2283 travellers and immigrants presented to a CanTravNet site, 88% 
      (N=2004) of whom were assigned a travel-related diagnosis. Top three destinations 
      for non-immigrant travellers were India (N=132), Mexico (N=103) and Cuba (N=89). 
      Fifty-one cases of malaria were imported by ill returned travellers during the study 
      period, 60% (N=30) of which were Plasmodium falciparum infections. Individuals 
      travelling to visit friends and relatives accounted for 83% of enteric fever cases 
      (15/18) and 41% of malaria cases (21/51). The requirement for inpatient management 
      was over-represented among those with malaria compared to those without malaria (25% 
      versus 2.8%; p<0.0001) and those travelling to visit friends and relatives versus 
      those travelling for other reasons (12.1% versus 2.4%; p<0.0001). Nine new cases of 
      HIV were diagnosed among the cohort, as well as one case of acute hepatitis B. 
      Emerging infections among travellers included hepatitis E virus (N=6), chikungunya 
      fever (N=4) and cutaneous leishmaniasis (N=16). Common chief complaints included 
      gastrointestinal (N=804), dermatologic (N=440) and fever (N=287). Common specific 
      causes of chief complaint of fever in the cohort were malaria (N=47/51 total cases), 
      dengue fever (14/18 total cases), enteric fever (14/17 total cases) and influenza 
      and influenza-like illness (15/21 total cases). Animal bites were the tenth most 
      common diagnosis among tourist travellers. INTERPRETATION: Our analysis of 
      surveillance data on ill returned Canadian travellers provides a recent update to 
      the spectrum of imported illness among travelling Canadians. Preventable 
      travel-acquired illnesses and injuries in the cohort include malaria, enteric fever, 
      HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis A, influenza and animal bites. Strategies to improve 
      uptake of preventive interventions such as malaria chemoprophylaxis, immunizations 
      and arthropod/animal avoidance may be warranted.

TI  - Epidemiological changes in leishmaniasis in Spain according to hospitalization-based 
      records, 1997-2011: raising awareness towards leishmaniasis in non-HIV patients.
PG  - e0003594

AB  - In Spain, Leishmania infantum is endemic, human visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis 
      cases occurring both in the Peninsula, as well as in the Balearic Islands. We aimed 
      to describe the clinical characteristics of leishmaniasis patients and the changes 
      in the disease evolution after the introduction of antiretroviral therapy in 1997. 
      In this descriptive study, we used Spanish Centralized Hospital Discharge Database 
      for the hospitalized leishmaniasis cases between 1997 and 2011. We included in the 
      analysis only the records having leishmaniasis as the first registered diagnosis and 
      calculated the hospitalization rates. Disease trend was described taking into 
      account the HIV status. Adjusted odds-ratio was used to estimate the association 
      between clinical and socio-demographic factors and HIV co-infection. Of the total 
      8010 Leishmaniasis hospitalizations records, 3442 had leishmaniasis as first 
      diagnosis; 2545/3442 (75.6%) were males and 2240/3442 (65.1%) aged between 14-65 
      years. Regarding disease forms, 2844/3442 (82.6%) of hospitalizations were due to 
      visceral leishmaniasis (VL), while 118/3442 (3.4%) hospitalizations were cutaneous 
      leishmaniasis (CL). Overall, 1737/2844 of VL (61.1%) were HIV negatives. An overall 
      increasing trend was observed for the records with leishmaniasis as first diagnosis 
      (p=0.113). Non-HIV leishmaniasis increased during this time period (p=0.021) while 
      leishmaniasis-HIV co-infection hospitalization revealed a slight descending trend 
      (p=0.717). Leishmaniasis-HIV co-infection was significantly associated with male sex 
      (aOR=1.6; 95% CI: 1.25-2.04), 16-64 years age group (aOR=17.4; 95%CI: 2.1-143.3), 
      visceral leishmaniasis aOR=6.1 (95%CI: 3.27-11.28) and solid neoplasms 4.5 (95% CI: 
      1.65-12.04). The absence of HIV co-infection was associated with lymph/hematopoietic 
      neoplasms (aOR=0.3; 95%CI:0.14-0.57), other immunodeficiency (aOR=0.04; 95% 
      CI:0.01-0.32) and transplant (aOR=0.01; 95%CI:0.00-0.07). Our findings suggest a 
      significant increase of hospitalization in the absence of HIV co-infection, with a 
      predomination of VL. We consider that clinicians in Spain should be aware of 
      leishmaniasis not only in the HIV population but also in non HIV patients, 
      especially for those having immunosuppression as an associate condition.

TI  - Dendritic cells as a tool to combat infectious diseases.
PG  - 153-7
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) form a network of potent antigen-presenting cells that 
      initiate and amplify immune responses. The detection and capture of microorganisms 
      by DCs trigger stimulus-specific maturation programs that enable DCs to convey 
      pathogen-associated signals to the adaptive branch of the immune system. The 
      appropriate activation of DCs is critical for their ability to direct the 
      development of either a Th1 or a Th2 response, thereby determining the outcome of 
      microbial infections. Advances in the understanding of DC interactions with microbes 
      provide new concepts for immune interventions. In different models of infectious 
      disease, it has been demonstrated that DCs can serve as vaccine carriers, mediating 
      protection against various types of pathogens. The studies of the requirements of ex 
      vivo manipulations of DCs may lead to the design of vaccines that induce protective 
      immunity to infections by appropriate targeting of DCs in vivo.

TI  - Quantitative proteomic analysis to determine differentially expressed proteins in 
      axenic amastigotes of Leishmania tropica and Leishmania major.
PG  - 1715-1724
LID - 10.1002/iub.2300 [doi]
AB  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis is commonly caused by Leishmania major and Leishmania 
      tropica. In the present study, the differential expression of proteins was 
      identified in the amastigote-like forms of L. tropica and L. major in Iranian 
      isolates. Initially, the samples were cultured and identified using PCR-RFLP 
      technique. The Leishmania isolates were then grown in host-free (axenic) culture and 
      prepared to amastigote-like forms, followed by the extraction of their proteins. To 
      identify significant differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) of two types of 
      Leishmania, the label-free quantitative proteomic technique was used based on 
      sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra mass 
      spectrometry. A total of 51 up/down-DEPs (fold change >2 and p-value <.05) were 
      identified between the axenic amastigote forms of L. major and L. tropica. Of these, 
      34 and 17 proteins were up-regulated in L. major and L. tropica, respectively. 
      Several enriched GO terms were identified via biological process analyses for DEPs; 
      furthermore, the metabolic process and translation were disclosed as top category in 
      the up-regulated proteins of both L. major and L. tropica species. Also, the KEGG 
      analysis revealed carbon metabolism and metabolic pathways term as the top pathways 
      in the proteins up-regulated in L. major and L. tropica, respectively. Taken 
      together, the numerous novel DEPs identified between the studied species could help 
      fully understand the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis and provide potential drug 
      targets and vaccine candidates.

TI  - Multilocus sequence analysis for Leishmania braziliensis outbreak investigation.
PG  - e2695
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002695 [doi]
LID - e2695
AB  - With the emergence of leishmaniasis in new regions around the world, molecular 
      epidemiological methods with adequate discriminatory power, reproducibility, high 
      throughput and inter-laboratory comparability are needed for outbreak investigation 
      of this complex parasitic disease. As multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) has been 
      projected as the future gold standard technique for Leishmania species 
      characterization, we propose a MLSA panel of six housekeeping gene loci (6pgd, mpi, 
      icd, hsp70, mdhmt, mdhnc) for investigating intraspecific genetic variation of L. 
      (Viannia) braziliensis strains and compare the resulting genetic clusters with 
      several epidemiological factors relevant to outbreak investigation. The recent 
      outbreak of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. (V.) braziliensis in the southern 
      Brazilian state of Santa Catarina is used to demonstrate the applicability of this 
      technique. Sequenced fragments from six genetic markers from 86 L. (V.) braziliensis 
      strains from twelve Brazilian states, including 33 strains from Santa Catarina, were 
      used to determine clonal complexes, genetic structure, and phylogenic networks. 
      Associations between genetic clusters and networks with epidemiological 
      characteristics of patients were investigated. MLSA revealed epidemiological 
      patterns among L. (V.) braziliensis strains, even identifying strains from imported 
      cases among the Santa Catarina strains that presented extensive homogeneity. 
      Evidence presented here has demonstrated MLSA possesses adequate discriminatory 
      power for outbreak investigation, as well as other potential uses in the molecular 
      epidemiology of leishmaniasis.

TI  - [Co-infections of leishmania/HIV in south Europe].
PG  - 187-93
AB  - The Leishmania/HIV co-infection has emerged as a result of the increasing overlap 
      between leishmaniasis (mainly visceral, more rarely cutaneous) and AIDS, which is 
      due to the spread of the AIDS pandemic to rural areas and that of visceral 
      leishmaniasis to suburban areas. Cases of co-infection have so far been reported 
      from 33 countries around the world, most of the cases have been notified in 
      south-western Europe. 1,627 cases have been notified from Spain, France, Italy and 
      Portugal. While Leishmania/HIV co-infection is increasing in eastern Africa, cases 
      of co-infection are expected to diminish in South-western Europe due to the new 
      highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). In 1998, a world wide WHO/UNAIDS 
      surveillance network was established, which now includes 28 member institutions. In 
      south-western Europe, the surveillance system based on 16 institutions is now well 
      established. The systematic use of standardized and recently computerized 
      case-report forms, the central international registry at WHO headquarters, and 
      finally the use of a geographic information system (GIS) for mapping and monitoring 
      co-infections have improved the overall quality of epidemiological data gathering. 
      All member institutions of the network report to WHO on an annual basis. World wide 
      information is analysed and periodically disseminated through international 
      publications. The GIS integrates epidemiological and demographic data sets and 
      allows for the mapping of co-infection cases down to locality level. The system can 
      be used to easily visualise and analyse the spatial distribution of co-infection 
      cases and to permit monitoring of the evolution of the distribution of the cases 
      over time. The risk of co-infected patients, as carriers of Leishmania in the blood, 
      to be a source of infection for the sandfly, has been recently confirmed. Moreover 
      intravenous drug users also transmit the disease through the sharing of needles.

TI  - Label-Free Proteomic Analysis Reveals Parasite-Specific Protein Alterations in 
      Macrophages Following Leishmania amazonensis, Leishmania major, or Leishmania 
      infantum Infection.
PG  - 851-862
LID - 10.1021/acsinfecdis.8b00338 [doi]
AB  - Leishmania is an obligate intracellular parasite known to modulate the host cell to 
      survive and proliferate. However, the complexity of host-parasite interactions 
      remains unclear. Also, the outcome of the disease has been recognized to be 
      species-specific and dependent on the host's immune responses. Proteomics has 
      emerged as a powerful tool to investigate the host-pathogen interface, allowing us 
      to deepen our knowledge about infectious diseases. Quantification of the relative 
      amount of proteins in a sample can be achieved using label-free proteomics, and for 
      the first time, we have used it to quantify Leishmania-specific protein alterations 
      in macrophages. Protein extracts were obtained and digested, and peptides were 
      identified and quantified using nano-LC coupled with tandem mass spectrometry 
      analyses. Protein expression was validated by Western blot analysis. Integrated 
      Proteomics Pipeline was used for peptide/protein identification and for 
      quantification and data processing. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used for network 
      analysis. In this work, we investigated how this intracellular parasite modulates 
      protein expression on a host macrophage by comparing three different Leishmania 
      species- L. amazonensis, one of the causative agents of cutaneous disease in the 
      Amazon region; L. major, another causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis in 
      Africa, the Middle East, China, and India; L. infantum, the causative agent of 
      visceral leishmaniasis affecting humans and dogs in Latin America-and 
      lipopolysaccharide stimulated macrophages as an in vitro inflammation model. Our 
      results revealed that Leishmania infection downregulates apoptosis pathways while 
      upregulating the activation of phagocytes/leukocytes and lipid accumulation.

AB  - Length of travel appears to be associated with health risks. GeoSentinel 
      Surveillance Network data for 4,039 long-term travelers (trip duration >6 months) 
      seen after travel during June 1, 1996, through December 31, 2008, were compared with 
      data for 24,807 short-term travelers (trip duration <1 month). Long-term travelers 
      traveled more often than short-term travelers for volunteer activities (39.7% vs. 
      7.0%) and business (25.2% vs. 13.8%). More long-term travelers were men (57.2% vs. 
      50.1%) and expatriates (54.0% vs. 8.9%); most had pretravel medical advice (70.3% 
      vs. 48.9%). Per 1,000 travelers, long-term travelers more often experienced chronic 
      diarrhea, giardiasis, Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax malaria, irritable bowel 
      syndrome (postinfectious), fatigue >1 month, eosinophilia, cutaneous leishmaniasis, 
      schistosomiasis, and Entamoeba histolytica diarrhea. Areas of concern for long-term 
      travelers were vector-borne diseases, contact-transmitted diseases, and 
      psychological problems. Our results can help prioritize screening for and diagnosis 
      of illness in long-term travelers and provide evidence-based pretravel advice.

TI  - Metabolic, immune, and gut microbial signals mount a systems response to Leishmania 
      major infection.
PG  - 318-29
LID - 10.1021/pr5008202 [doi]
AB  - Parasitic infections such as leishmaniasis induce a cascade of host physiological 
      responses, including metabolic and immunological changes. Infection with Leishmania 
      major parasites causes cutaneous leishmaniasis in humans, a neglected tropical 
      disease that is difficult to manage. To understand the determinants of pathology, we 
      studied L. major infection in two mouse models: the self-healing C57BL/6 strain and 
      the nonhealing BALB/c strain. Metabolic profiling of urine, plasma, and feces via 
      proton NMR spectroscopy was performed to discover parasite-specific imprints on 
      global host metabolism. Plasma cytokine status and fecal microbiome were also 
      characterized as additional metrics of the host response to infection. Results 
      demonstrated differences in glucose and lipid metabolism, distinctive immunological 
      phenotypes, and shifts in microbial composition between the two models. We present a 
      novel approach to integrate such metrics using correlation network analyses, whereby 
      self-healing mice demonstrated an orchestrated interaction between the biological 
      measures shortly after infection. In contrast, the response observed in nonhealing 
      mice was delayed and fragmented. Our study suggests that trans-system communication 
      across host metabolism, the innate immune system, and gut microbiome is key for a 
      successful host response to L. major and provides a new concept, potentially 
      translatable to other diseases.

TI  - Phylogeography of the Lutzomyia gomezi (Diptera: Phlebotominae) on the Panama 
      Isthmus.
PG  - 9
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-7-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lutzomyia gomezi (Nitzulescu, 1931) is one of the main Leishmania 
      (Vianna) panamensis vectors in Panama, and despite its medical significance, there 
      are no population genetic studies regarding this species. In this study, we used the 
      sequences of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b/start of NADH1 and the nuclear 
      elongation gene α-1 in order to analyze genetic variation and phylogeographic 
      structure of the Lu. gomezi populations. METHODS: A total of 86 Lu. gomezi 
      individuals were captured in 38 locations where cutaneous leishmaniasis occurred. 
      DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform methods and amplification of genes was 
      performed using PCR primers for mitochondrial and nuclear markers. RESULTS: We found 
      a total of 37 and 26 haplotypes of mitochondrial and nuclear genes, high haplotype 
      diversity (h) for all three populations were detected with both molecular markers. 
      Nucleotide diversity (π) was estimated to be high for all three populations with the 
      mitochondrial marker, which was opposite to the estimate with the nuclear marker. In 
      the AMOVA Φst recorded moderate (mitochondrial) and small (nuclear) population 
      structure with statistical significance among populations. The analysis of the 
      fixation index (Fst) used to measure the differentiation of populations showed that 
      with the exception of the population located in the region of Bocas del Toro, the 
      other populations presented with minor genetic differentiation. The median-Joining 
      network of the mitochondrial marker reveled three clusters and recorded four 
      haplotypes exclusively of localities sampled from Western Panama, demonstrating 
      strong divergence. We found demographic population expansion with Fu´s Fs neutrality 
      test. In the analysis mismatch distribution was observed as a bimodal curve. 
      CONCLUSION: Lu. gomezi is a species with higher genetic pool or variability and mild 
      population structure, due to possible capacity migration and local adaptation to 
      environmental changes or colonization potential. Thus, knowledge of the genetic 
      population and evolutionary history is useful to understand the implications of 
      different population genetic structures for cutaneous leishmaniasis epidemiology.

PG  - 1595-1606
LID - 10.1080/10717544.2018.1494222 [doi]
AB  - Topical drug delivery against cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) signifies an effective 
      alternate for improving the availability and reducing the toxicity associated with 
      the parenteral administration of conventional sodium stibogluconate (SSG) injection. 
      The basic aim of the study was to develop nano-deformable liposomes (NDLs) for the 
      dermal delivery of SSG against CL. NDLs were formulated by a modified thin film 
      hydration method and optimized via Box-Behnken statistical design. The 
      physicochemical properties of SSG-NDLs were established in terms of vesicle size 
      (195.1 nm), polydispersity index (0.158), zeta potential (-32.8 mV), and entrapment 
      efficiency (35.26%). Moreover, deformability index, in vitro release, and macrophage 
      uptake studies were also accomplished. SSG-NDLs were entrapped within Carbopol gel 
      network for the ease of skin application. The ex vivo skin permeation study revealed 
      that SSG-NDLs gel provided 10-fold higher skin retention towards the deeper skin 
      layers, attained without use of classical permeation enhancers. Moreover, in vivo 
      skin irritation and histopathological studies verified safety of the topically 
      applied formulation. Interestingly, the cytotoxic potential of SSG-NDLs (1.3 mg/ml) 
      was higher than plain SSG (1.65 mg/ml). The anti-leishmanial activity on 
      intramacrophage amastigote model of Leishmania tropica showed that IC(50) value of 
      the SSG-NDLs was ∼ fourfold lower than the plain drug solution with marked increase 
      in the selectivity index. The in vivo results displayed higher anti-leishmanial 
      activity by efficiently healing lesion and successfully reducing parasite burden. 
      Concisely, the outcomes indicated that the targeted delivery of SSG could be 
      accomplished by using topically applied NDLs for the effective treatment of CL.

TI  - Richness and Diversity of Phlebotomine Sand Flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) in North 
      Khorasan Province, Northeast of Iran.
PG  - 232-239
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine the species composition, richness and diversity 
      indices of the Phlebotomine sand flies at different topographic condition in 
      visceral (VL) and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) foci in the northeast of Iran. 
      METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted during 2016 in North Khorasan 
      Province. The sampling was focused on rural regions, where human cases of VL and/or 
      CL were diagnosed and reported during last 5 years. Sand flies were collected three 
      times each twenty days during peak periods of seasonal activity. Seven collection 
      methods were used. Some Alpha and Beta diversity indices were calculated. RESULTS: 
      Overall, 7253 sand flies were collected and identified. They were from 19 species of 
      Phlebotominae sand-flies. Phlebotomus sergenti and Ph. papatasi were the most 
      prevalent (84.9%) species in the study area. Species richness (S) was very different 
      in three areas and were18, 8, and 4 respectively but Evenness (E) were 0.357, 0.345, 
      and 0.380, so evenness was almost equal in the study areas. Shannon Index (H) and 
      Margalef Richness Index were calculated 1.033, 0.718, 0.527 and 2.117, 0.8998, 
      0.4006 respectively. CONCLUSION: The sand fly fauna in North Khorasan Province was 
      very rich and often included some of the most important proven or suspected vectors 
      of leishmaniasis. Species diversity indices (Shannon index, and Simpson's index) 
      were not high due to decreasing in evenness. The Margalef richness index could 
      accurately reflect the biodiversity of sand flies between three subtidal locations.

AB  - Systems analyses have facilitated the characterization of metabolic networks of 
      several organisms. We have reconstructed the metabolic network of Leishmania major, 
      a poorly characterized organism that causes cutaneous leishmaniasis in mammalian 
      hosts. This network reconstruction accounts for 560 genes, 1112 reactions, 1101 
      metabolites and 8 unique subcellular localizations. Using a systems-based approach, 
      we hypothesized a comprehensive set of lethal single and double gene deletions, some 
      of which were validated using published data with approximately 70% accuracy. 
      Additionally, we generated hypothetical annotations to dozens of previously 
      uncharacterized genes in the L. major genome and proposed a minimal medium for 
      growth. We further demonstrated the utility of a network reconstruction with two 
      proof-of-concept examples that yielded insight into robustness of the network in the 
      presence of enzymatic inhibitors and delineation of promastigote/amastigote 
      stage-specific metabolism. This reconstruction and the associated network analyses 
      of L. major is the first of its kind for a protozoan. It can serve as a tool for 
      clarifying discrepancies between data sources, generating hypotheses that can be 
      experimentally validated and identifying ideal therapeutic targets.

      revealed by PCR-RFLP of kDNA minicircles.

LID - S0001-706X(16)30787-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.02.016 [doi]
AB  - In Morocco, Leishmania infantum is the main etiologic agent of human and canine 
      visceral leishmaniasis (VL). This species has been proven to be an opportunistic 
      agent in HIV+ patients and is also responsible of sporadic cutaneous leishmaniasis 
      (CL).This work aims to evaluate the genetic variability of Moroccan L. infantum 
      strains based on PCR-RFLP analysis of the kinetoplastid DNA (kDNA) minicircles. A 
      total of 75 DNA samples extracted from positive Giemsa-stained smears (n=32) and 
      from L. infantum cultures (n=43) was studied. The samples have been taken from VL 
      patients infected (n=7) or not (n=56) by HIV, patients with CL (n=2) and finally 
      from infected dogs (n=10). An hypervariable region of kDNA was amplified using the 
      primers MC1 and MC2; the PCR products were digested separately by a panel of nine 
      restriction enzymes. The presence or absence of restriction fragments was scored in 
      a binary matrix and the SplitsTree4 software was used for the construction of a 
      Neighbor-Net network. Moroccan L. infantum population showed an important level of 
      variability with the identification of 6 genotypes. For each genotype a PCR product 
      was sequenced, confirming the presence of all the expected restriction sites. The 
      predominant profile was the genotype B. A new genotype, named Q was detected for the 
      first time, whereas the four other genotypes (G, K, N and O) were reported 
      sporadically in the Mediterranean basin. The Neighbor-Net network segregates our L. 
      infantum population into 3 clusters: Cluster I includes genotype B, cluster II 
      grouping the genotypes O, Q and G and finally the cluster III contains the genotype 
      N. The kDNA-PCR-RFLP assay is suitable for use directly on biological samples; it 
      reveals an important degree of genetic variability among L. infantum strains even 
      those belonging to the same zymodeme what is of great epidemiological interest.

TI  - Metabolomics-Based Study of Logarithmic and Stationary Phases of Promastigotes in 
      Leishmania major by 1H NMR Spectroscopy.
PG  - 77-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cutaneous leishmaniasis is one of the most important parasitic diseases 
      in humans. In this disease, one of the responsible organisms is Leishmania major, 
      which is transmitted by sandfly vector. There are specific differences in 
      biochemical profiles and metabolite pathways in logarithmic and stationary phases of 
      Leishmania parasites. In the present study, 1H NMR spectroscopy was used to examine 
      the metabolites outliers in the logarithmic and stationary phases of promastigotes 
      in L. major to enlighten more about the transmission mechanism in metacyclogenesis 
      of L. major. METHODS: Promastigote was cultured, logarithmic and stationary phases 
      were separated by the peanut agglutinin, and cell metabolites were extracted. 1H NMR 
      spectroscopy was applied, and outliers were analyzed using principal component 
      analysis. RESULTS: The most altered metabolites in stationary and logarithmic phases 
      were limited to citraconic acid, isopropylmalic acid, L-leucine, ornithine, caprylic 
      acid, capric acid, and acetic acid. CONCLUSION: 1H NMR spectroscopy could play an 
      important role in the characterization of metabolites in biochemical pathways during 
      a metacyclogenesis process. These metabolites and their pathways can help in 
      exploiting a transmission mechanism in metacyclogenesis, and outcoming data might be 
      used in the metabolic network reconstruction of L. major modeling.

TI  - Progressive disease or protective immunity to Leishmania major infection: the result 
      of a network of stimulatory and inhibitory interactions.
PG  - 372-90
AB  - The study of experimental infection of inbred strains of mice with the intracellular 
      protozoan parasite Leishmania major has contributed significantly not only to our 
      understanding of this fascinating host/parasite relationship but also to that of 
      many basic immunological phenomena. Much has been learned about the cognate 
      interaction of antigen-specific T cells and antigen-presenting cells, about cytokine 
      and T cell subset regulation, and the requirements for costimulation. Specifically, 
      the immune response to experimental L. major infection is the paradigm for polarized 
      T helper cell (Th) 1 and Th2 differentiation. In this model system a Th1 response 
      characterized by interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma secretion leads to 
      self-curing disease, whereas a Th2 response (IL-4, IL-10) leads to nonhealing 
      disease. Numerous manipulations, including the injection of cytokines and of 
      neutralizing anti-cytokine antibodies, cytokine transgene expression, and more 
      recently cytokine and cytokine receptor gene knockout studies, have all provided 
      intriguing new pieces to the still incomplete mosaic of our understanding of the 
      immune response. Some of these findings were clearly unexpected and are still 
      incompletely understood. For instance, based on earlier neutralizing anti-IL-4 
      monoclonal antibody injection studies, IL-4 gene-disrupted BALB/c mice were expected 
      to be unable to mount the biased Th2 response typical of the IL-4+/+ wild-type mice 
      and to be able to control their lesions; quite unexpectedly, the BALB/c IL-4 
      knockout mice remain unable to heal their L. major infection. Based on these 
      unexpected findings, we reexamine the literature in an attempt to resolve this 
      apparent paradox and to relate the large body of experimental findings in the mouse 
      system to that which is known about natural and experimental infections in the 
      human.

TI  - The population structure of Lutzomyia verrucarum (Diptera: Psycodidae), a Bartonella 
      bacilliformis and Leishmania peruviana vector in Peru.
PG  - 77-84
AB  - The population genetic structure of Lutzomyia verrucarum (Townsend), a sand fly 
      disease vector of Carrion's disease and cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Peruvian 
      Andes, was characterized by sequencing 653 bp of cytochrome b and 1,125 bp of the 
      NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 genes of its mitochondrial genome. DNA sequence 
      variation within and between valleys was compared in a sample of 220 sand flies from 
      three valleys (Purisima, Huaylas, and Conchucos) and five departments (Amazonas, 
      Cajamarca, Piura, Lima, and Huancavelica). Gene network and phylogenetic analyses 
      indicated a high similarity of haplotypes collected within a single valley (0-0.52% 
      nucleotide divergence). Flies from each valley had unique genotypes not shared with 
      specimens from other valleys or from more distant regions (0.8-3.1% nucleotide 
      divergence). Mountain ranges and geographic distance appear to have impeded 
      migration (N(m) = < 0.18) between valleys and separated populations into discrete 
      genetic units.

TI  - Mucosal leishmaniasis patients display an activated inflammatory T-cell phenotype 
      associated with a nonbalanced monocyte population.
PG  - 70-8
AB  - Leishmania braziliensis is a parasite that can induce at least two clinical forms of 
      leishmaniasis in humans: cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and mucosal leishmaniasis 
      (ML). In humans, the specific mechanisms that determine which form will develop 
      following infection are not well established. In this study, peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells from 17 CL and 9 ml patients were compared both ex vivo and after 
      culture with soluble leishmania antigen (SLA). Patients with ML presented a higher 
      frequency of activated T cells as measured by ex vivo frequencies of (CD4+)(CD69+), 
      (CD4+)(CD28-), (CD4+)(CD62L-) and (CD8+)(CD69+) than those with CL. Moreover, after 
      stimulation with SLA, patients with ML presented a higher frequency of 
      TNF-alpha-producing CD4+ and CD14+ cells than CL individuals. While CL patients 
      displayed a positive correlation between the frequency of IL-10 and 
      TNF-alpha-producing monocytes, the ML patients did not. This lack of a positive 
      correlation between IL-10-producing and TNF-alpha-producing monocytes in ML patients 
      could lead to a less controlled inflammatory response in vivo. These results 
      corroborate with a model of an exacerbated, unregulated, immune response in ML 
      patients and point to key immunomodulatory leucocyte populations and cytokine 
      networks that may be involved in the development of immunopathology in ML patients.

AB  - Leishmaniasis is an infectious disease caused by Leishmania that widespread in 98 
      countries. The differentiation of Leishmania (L) from procyclic to metacyclic 
      promastigote has occurred along with morphological and biochemical changes in 
      proteome scale. We aim here to identify the proteomes of two successive 
      developmental forms (procyclic and metacyclic promastigotes) from Leishmania major 
      isolates using SWATH-MS quantitative proteomics technique. Isolated proteins from 
      procyclic and metacyclic lysate were digested, fractionated and subjected to 
      SWATH-MS. Proteins significantly different in abundance were analyzed using gene 
      ontology (GO) and protein-protein interaction network (PPIN). Our study showed that 
      52 proteins were changed in abundance between the two consecutive developmental 
      stages. Differentially expressed proteins were classified into nine classes by GO 
      analysis. Significant modulations in translation, antioxidant and stress-related 
      defenses, energy metabolism, structural and motility-related proteins were detected 
      between procyclic and metacyclic stages. We found that elongation factor-2 and 
      various structural constituents of ribosome were down-regulated during 
      metacyclogenesis, while motility related proteins including ADP-ribosylation 
      factor-3, paraflegellar rod protein-2C and tubulin alpha-chain were up regulated. 
      According to network analysis, ENOL has been introduced as main hub-bottleneck 
      protein and EF-1b, Hsp60 and GDH have been determined as seed proteins. Our results 
      show that significant proteins in abundance are crucial features of metacyclogenesis 
      in L. major. The protein function analysis illustrated that synthetic pathway 
      involved proteins were down-regulated in metacyclic, which is the main feature of 
      this stage of parasite growth cycle, while up-regulation of motility and energy 
      metabolism related proteins is consistent with infective feature of metacyclic 
      stage. Based on our results, we suppose that differentially expressed proteins 
      possibly play a critical role in L. major differentiation. In addition, our finding 
      demonstrated the possibility of SWATH-MS as viable technique to faster detect new 
      stage-specific proteins in Leishmania and further studies are required for the 
      validation of the results.

AB  - Leishmaniasis is a group of neglected tropical diseases caused by protozoan 
      parasites of the Leishmania genus. The absence of effective vaccines and the 
      limitations of current treatments make the search for effective therapies a real 
      need. Different plant-derived essential oils (EOs) have shown antileishmanial 
      effects, in particular from Bixa orellana L. (EO-Bo) and Dysphania ambrosioides (L.) 
      Mosyakin & Clemants (EO-Da). In the present study, the EO-Bo and EO-Da, formulated 
      in nanocochleates (EO-Bo-NC and EO-Da-NC, respectively), were evaluated in vitro and 
      in vivo against L. amazonensis. The EO-Bo-NC and EO-Da-NC did not increase the in 
      vitro inhibitory activity of the EOs, although the EO-Bo-NC showed reduced cytotoxic 
      effects. In the animal model, both formulations (30 mg/kg/intralesional route/every 
      4 days/4 times) showed no deaths or weight loss greater than 10%. In the animal 
      (mouse) model, EO-Bo-NC contributed to the control of infection (p < 0.05) in 
      comparison with EO-Bo treatment, while the mice treated with EO-Da-NC exhibited 
      larger lesions (p < 0.05) compared to those treated with EO-Da. The enhanced in vivo 
      activity observed for EO-Bo-NC suggests that lipid-based nanoformulations like 
      nanocochleates should be explored for their potential in the proper delivery of 
      drugs, and in particular, the delivery of hydrophobic materials for effective 
      cutaneous leishmaniasis treatment.

AB  - Leishmania parasites are responsible for a range of clinical manifestations ranging 
      from self-resolving cutaneous sores to life-threatening diseases. The management of 
      leishmaniasis is complicated in part by the scarcity of treatment options but also 
      by the emerging or established resistance to available drugs. A major driver of 
      resistance in Leishmania is the amplification of resistance genes taking advantage 
      of the highly repetitive genomic landscape of the parasite. The recent advent of 
      whole genome gain of function screens gave new momentum to the study of such 
      resistance mechanisms, leading to the identification of novel resistance factors and 
      drug targets against approved drugs, which include antimony (SbIII), miltefosine 
      (MIL), paromomycin (PMM), and amphotericin B. However, these screens do not pinpoint 
      single nucleotide variations (SNVs), an important contributor of drug resistance. To 
      fill the gap, our recent study describes the optimization of chemical mutagenesis 
      coupled to next generation sequencing, an approach called Mut-seq, as a way to 
      explore networks of drug resistance genes in organisms with a diploid to mosaic 
      aneuploid genome like Leishmania. Our Mut-seq screen revealed associations between 
      genes linked with lipid metabolism and resistance to MIL, and highlighted the role 
      of a protein kinase in translation leading to resistance to PMM.

TI  - Expression profiling of Sudanese visceral leishmaniasis patients pre- and 
      post-treatment with sodium stibogluconate.
LID - 10.1111/pim.12431 [doi]
AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Sudan caused by Leishmania donovani is fatal in 
      susceptible individuals if untreated. Treatment with sodium stibogluconate (SSG) 
      leads to post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) in 58% of patients. Here, 
      Affymetrix microarrays were used to identify genes differentially expressed in lymph 
      nodes (N=9 paired samples) pre- and post-treatment with SSG. Using the Bioconductor 
      package limma, 438 genes from 28 869 post-quality-control probe sets were 
      differentially expressed (P(nominal) ≤.02) post- vs pretreatment. Canonical pathway 
      analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis™ identified "role of nuclear factor of 
      activated T-cell in regulation of immune response" (P(nominal) =1.35×10(-5) ; 
      P(BH)(-adjusted) =4.79×10(-3) ), "B-cell development" (P(nominal) =2.04×10(-4) ; 
      P(BH)(-adjusted) =.024), "Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis in macrophages and 
      monocytes" (P(nominal) =2.04×10(-4) ; P(BH)(-adjusted) =.024) and "OX40 signalling" 
      (P(nominal) =2.82×10(-4) ; P(BH)(-adjusted) =.025) as pathways differentially 
      regulated post- vs pretreatment. Major network hub genes included TP53, FN1, MYC, 
      BCL2, JUN, SYK, RUNX2, MMP1 and ACTA2. Top endogenous upstream regulators included 
      IL-7 (P=2.28×10(-6) ), TNF (P=4.26×10(-6) ), Amyloid Precursor Protein 
      (P=4.23×10(-5) ) and SPI1/PI.1 (P=1.17×10(-7) ). Top predicted chemical drug 
      regulators included the flavonoid genistein (P=4.56×10(-7) ) and the quinoline 
      alkaloid camptothecin (P=5.14×10(-5) ). These results contribute to our 
      understanding of immunopathology associated with VL and response to SSG treatment. 
      Further replication could identify novel therapeutic strategies that improve on SSG 
      treatment and reduce the likelihood of progression to PKDL.

TI  - Introduction and expansion of human American visceral leishmaniasis in the state of 
      Sao Paulo, Brazil, 1999-2011.
PG  - 691-700
LID - 10.1590/S0034-8910.2013047004454 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the spread of human American visceral leishmaniasis and 
      identify the key municipalities for developing surveillance and control activities. 
      METHODS: The area of the study was composed of the 316 municipalities in the state 
      of Sao Paulo belonging to the five health districts in which human American visceral 
      leishmaniasis occurs, using data on autochthonous cases and deaths according to the 
      reporting year and municipality in which the death occurred. The incidence, 
      mortality and case fatality rates for each municipality and for the entire area were 
      calculated. An empirical Bayes estimator was used to calculate the local Bayesian 
      incidence and rates of mortality per municipality, and Kriging was used to visualize 
      the spatial distribution of temperature and rainfall. RESULTS: A total of 73 
      municipalities with transmission of the disease were identified. Human American 
      visceral leishmaniasis was first detected in areas with higher temperatures and 
      lower rainfall, but it also spread in cooler and wetter areas. The expansion of 
      human American visceral leishmaniasis occurred along a main axis of dissemination, 
      from Northwest to Southeast, following the Marechal Rondon highway and the 
      Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline, and along a secondary axis that was derived from the 
      main axis, which runs both North and South, following the highway network. Rates of 
      incidence according to health district exhibit a peak, followed by a fall, except 
      the Sao Jose do Rio Preto region. Higher concentrations of municipalities with high 
      incidence and mortality rates were observed in the Araçatuba, Presidente Prudente 
      and Marília health districts. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates possible 
      determinants of the spread of disease, including the Marechal Rondon highway and the 
      construction of the Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline. Climatic factors seemed to play no 
      role in the spread. The use of spatial analysis techniques allowed the 
      municipalities where cases and deaths are possibly underreported to be identified, 
      which indicated the municipalities which should be prioritized for the development 
      of surveillance and control activities.

TI  - Cytokine interactions in experimental cutaneous leishmaniasis.
PG  - 230-8
AB  - Destruction of intracellularly living Leishmania major amastigotes is achieved by 
      activated macrophages. In this report, we have investigated the contribution of 
      IL-4, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma to the induction of antileishmanial macrophage 
      activation. It was found that as single lymphokine only IFN-gamma led to amastigote 
      elimination by peritoneal exudate macrophages. Neither IL-4 nor TNF-alpha or the 
      combination of both cytokines led to antimicrobial activation. When the macrophages 
      were incubated with concentrations of IFN-gamma that by themselves were insufficient 
      for maximum cell activation, it was found that both IL-4 and TNF-alpha very 
      effectively synergized with IFN-gamma for induction of antiparasitic activity. The 
      activation which was achieved when IFN-gamma was combined with IL-4 could be blocked 
      not only with antibodies to either of the lymphokines, but also with an antiserum 
      specific for TNF-alpha, suggesting the involvement of endogenously generated 
      TNF-alpha in this synergism. Any of the synergistic activities observed presumably 
      lead to the activation of the L-arginine dependent pathway used by the cell for the 
      production of nitrogen oxides as effector molecules for parasite killing since 
      NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), a specific inhibitor of this pathway, completely 
      blocked the killing of intracellular parasites. We conclude that macrophage 
      activation for antiparasitic activity is directed by a complex network of 
      cytokine-interactions, in which IL-4 and TNF-alpha very effectively synergize 
      positively with low levels of IFN-gamma.

TI  - The effects of CCR7 and related signaling pathways on Leishmania major -infected 
      human dendritic cells.
PG  - 13145-13156
LID - 10.1002/jcp.27985 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In our research, we aimed to investigate the roles of CC-chemokine 
      receptor 7 (CCR7) and relevant signaling pathways in Leishmania major-infected human 
      dendritic cells (DCs). METHODS: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in L. 
      major-infected human DCs were selected out and visualized using R program. Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis was conducted for investigation 
      of significantly enriched signaling pathways and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis 
      was carried out for the unveiling of enriched Molecular Functions and Biological 
      Processes in L. major-infected human DCs. Besides, Hub gene was screened out 
      using weighted gene coexpression network analysis and Cytoscape. In addition, 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and real-time quantitative polymerase chain 
      reaction were used for detection of relative expression of CCR7, interleukin-12 
      (IL-12), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in L. major-infected human DCs and western blot 
      analysis was used for detection of relative expression of CCR7 and other proteins in 
      JAK-STAT signaling pathway in L. major-infected human DCs. RESULTS: CCR7 was 
      upregulated and both chemokine and JAK-STAT signaling pathway were activated in L. 
      major-infected human DCs. During the L. major infection, total number of L. 
      major-infected human DCs were increased, as well as the relative expression levels 
      of CCR7, IL-12, and IFN-γ and proteins in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. 
      Overexpression of CCR7 not only increased expression levels of IL-12 and IFN-γ but 
      also activated the JAK-STAT signaling pathway to affect the leishmaniasis 
      progression. CONCLUSION: L. major infection-induced activation of CCR7, as well as 
      JAK2 and STAT1, might well upregulate the expression of BAX yet suppress the 
      expression of both Bcl2 and c-Jun to affect leishmaniasis progression.

LID - 10.1016/j.inhe.2009.12.005 [doi]
AB  - Surveillance data indicates that the number of cutaneous (CL), mucocutaneous (ML) 
      and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases has increased globally and in Europe during 
      the past decades. Leishmaniasis is only seen as an imported disease in the 
      Netherlands. We investigated occurrence in the Netherlands through an analysis of 
      Leishmania patients sent to our laboratory and to the nationwide network of the 
      pathology departments between 1996 and 2007. The majority of patients suffered from 
      CL, and an outbreak among military personnel stationed in endemic regions in 2005 
      was noted. ML was rarely found. However, the occurrence of VL has clearly increased. 
      Physicians in non-endemic regions should be aware that leishmaniasis can be 
      contracted as close as Southern Europe and that it is not limited to tropical and 
      subtropical regions only.

AB  - Leishmania, a protozoan parasite, causes a wide range of human diseases ranging from 
      the localized self-healing cutaneous lesions to fatal visceral leishmaniasis. 
      Toxicity of traditional first line drugs and emergence of drug-resistant strains 
      have worsened the situation. DNA topoisomerase II in kinetoplastid protozoan 
      parasites are of immense interest as drug target because they take part in 
      replication of unusual kinetoplast DNA network. In this study, we have taken 
      target-based therapeutic approaches to combat leishmaniasis. Two isobenzofuranone 
      compounds, viz., (1) 3,5-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-7-hydroxyisobenzofuran-1(3H)-one 
      (JVPH3) and (2) (4-bromo)-3'-hydroxy-5'-(4-bromophenyl)-benzophenone(JVPH4) were 
      synthesized chemically and characterized by NMR and mass spectrometry analysis. 
      Activity of type II DNA topoisomerase of leishmania (LdTOPII) was monitored by 
      decatenation assay and plasmid cleavage assay. The antiparasitic activity of these 
      compounds was checked in experimental BALB/c mice model of visceral leishmaniasis. 
      Isobenzofuranone derivatives exhibited potent antileishmanial effect on both 
      antimony (Sb) sensitive and resistant parasites. Treatment with isobenzofuranone 
      derivatives on promastigotes caused induction of reactive oxygen species 
      (ROS)-mediated apoptosis like cell death in leishmania. Both the compounds inhibited 
      the decatenation activity of LdTOPII but have no effect on bi-subunit topoisomerase 
      IB. Treatment of LdTOPII with isobenzofuranone derivatives did not stabilize 
      cleavage complex formation both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, treatment with 
      isobenzofuranone derivatives on Leishmania donovani-infected mice resulted in 
      clearance of parasites in liver and spleen by induction of Th1 cytokines. Taken 
      together, our data suggest that these compounds can be exploited as potential 
      antileishmanial agents targeted to DNA topoisomerase II of the parasite.

TI  - Heterogeneity of molecular resistance patterns in antimony-resistant field isolates 
      of Leishmania species from the western Mediterranean area.

AB  - Antimonials remain the first-line treatment for the various manifestations of 
      leishmaniasis in most areas where the disease is endemic, and increasing cases of 
      therapeutic failure associated with parasite resistance have been reported. In this 
      study, we assessed the molecular status of 47 clinical isolates of Leishmania 
      causing visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis from Algeria, Tunisia, and southern 
      France. In total, we examined 14 genes that have been shown to exhibit significant 
      variations in DNA amplification, mRNA levels, or protein expression with respect to 
      resistance to antimonials. The gene status of each clinical isolate was assessed via 
      qPCR and qRT-PCR. We then compared the molecular pattern against the phenotype 
      determined via an in vitro sensitivity test of the clinical isolates against 
      meglumine antimoniate, which is considered the reference technique. Our results 
      demonstrate significant DNA amplification and/or RNA overexpression in 56% of the 
      clinical isolates with the resistant phenotype. All clinical isolates that exhibited 
      significant overexpression of at least 2 genes displayed a resistant phenotype. 
      Among the 14 genes investigated, 10 genes displayed either significant amplification 
      or overexpression in at least 1 clinical isolate; these genes are involved in 
      several metabolic pathways. Moreover, various gene associations were observed 
      depending on the clinical isolates, supporting the multifactorial nature of 
      Leishmania resistance. Molecular resistance features were found in the 3 Leishmania 
      species investigated (Leishmania infantum, Leishmania major, and Leishmania 
      killicki). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the involvement of 
      molecular resistance genes in field isolates of Leishmania major and Leishmania 
      killicki with the resistance phenotype.

AB  - New therapeutic strategies against leishmaniasis are desirable, since the treatment 
      against disease presents problems, such as the toxicity, high cost and/or parasite 
      resistance. As consequence, new antileishmanial compounds are necessary to be 
      identified, as presenting high activity against Leishmania, but low toxicity in 
      mammalian hosts. In the present study, a Leishmania proteome mining strategy was 
      developed, in order to select new drug targets with low homology to human proteins, 
      but that are considered relevant for the parasite' survival. Results showed a 
      hypothetical protein, which was functionally annotated as a glucosidase-like 
      protein, as presenting such characteristics. This protein was associated with the 
      metabolic network of the N-Glycan biosynthesis pathway in Leishmania, and two 
      specific inhibitors - acarbose and miglitol - were predicted to be potential targets 
      against it. In this context, miglitol 
      [1-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-2-(hydroxymethyl)piperidine-3,4,5-triol] was tested against 
      stationary promastigotes and axenic amastigotes of the Leishmania amazonensis and 
      L. infantum species, and results showed high values of antileishmanial inhibition 
      against both parasite species. Miglitol showed also efficacy in the treatment of 
      Leishmania-infected macrophages; thus denoting its potential use as an 
      antileishmanial candidate. In conclusion, this work presents a new drug target 
      identified by a proteome mining strategy associated with bioinformatics tools, and 
      suggested its use as a possible candidate to be applied in the treatment against 
      disease.

TI  - Genetic structure of Mediterranean populations of the sandfly Phlebotomus papatasi 
      by mitochondrial cytochrome b haplotype analysis.
PG  - 270-7
AB  - Phlebotomus papatasi (Scopoli) (Diptera: Psychodidae) is the main vector of 
      Leishmania major Yakimoff & Schokhor; which is the cause of self-limiting cutaneous 
      leishmaniasis in the Old World. This sandfly is found in houses, animal shelters, 
      caves and rodent burrows. It has a large geographical range, which includes the 
      Middle East and the Mediterranean regions. A population analysis of colony and field 
      specimens of P. papatasi was conducted on 25 populations originating from 10 
      countries. The distribution of haplotypes of the maternally inherited mitochondrial 
      cytochrome b gene were analysed to assess the population differentiation of P. 
      papatasi. Alignment of a 442-basepair region at the 3' end of the gene identified 21 
      haplotypes and 33 segregating sites from 131 sandflies. The pattern of sequence 
      variations did not support the existence of a species complex. The median-joining 
      network method was used to describe both the origin of the haplotypes and the 
      population structure; haplotypes tended to cluster by geographical location, 
      suggesting some level of genetic differentiation between populations. Our findings 
      indicate the presence of significant population differentiation for populations 
      derived from Syria, Turkey, Palestine, Israel, Jordan and Egypt. Knowledge of 
      population differentiation among P. papatasi populations is important for 
      understanding patterns of dispersal in this species and for planning appropriate 
      control measures.

LID - 10.1039/c2ib20037f [doi]
AB  - Systems biology aims to develop mathematical models of biological systems by 
      integrating experimental and theoretical techniques by leveraging on the genome wide 
      data to unravel the complexity of gene regulation. Despite the availability of 
      effective chemotherapy, leishmaniasis continues to be one of the major parasitic 
      infections that affect the human population worldwide. Currently, little is known of 
      the structural biology of the parasites that are responsible for the disease and few 
      attempts have been made to develop second generation drugs, which may become 
      essential if multi-drug resistance arises. These facts make the discovery of novel 
      drug targets a priority. Multiscale modeling and simulation techniques permit us to 
      study the spatial and temporal properties of large systems to be simulated using 
      atomic-detail structures. The estimation of kinetic parameters for the mathematical 
      modeling provides a basis for iterative manipulation of biochemical pathways. In 
      this paper, emphasis is laid on the discrete regulation of gene or protein 
      expression as modeling can be done based on pure qualitative knowledge about 
      interaction between genes or proteins that is widely available from the existing 
      experimental methodologies. IPC synthase is one of them, believed to play a pivotal 
      role in the pathogenesis of Leishmania sp. and resides in an acidic macrophage 
      phagolysosome, defining a new class of eukaryotic sphingolipid synthases. This work 
      will facilitate the rational development of inhibitors against a protozoan enzyme 
      with no mammalian equivalent, leading to the prospect of anti-protozoal compounds 
      with minimal toxic side effects. Henceforth, it can be said that exploiting the 
      interactome for novel human drug targets could provide new therapeutic avenues 
      towards the treatment of infectious diseases, which could ameliorate the growing 
      clinical challenge of drug-resistant infections.

TI  - AFLP polymorphisms allow high resolution genetic analysis of American Tegumentary 
      Leishmaniasis agents circulating in Panama and other members of the Leishmania 
      genus.
PG  - e73177

LID - e73177
AB  - American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis is caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania, 
      and causes significant health problems throughout the Americas. In Panama, 
      Leishmania parasites are endemic, causing thousands of new cases every year, mostly 
      of the cutaneous form. In the last years, the burden of the disease has increased, 
      coincident with increasing disturbances in its natural sylvatic environments. The 
      study of genetic variation in parasites is important for a better understanding of 
      the biology, population genetics, and ultimately the evolution and epidemiology of 
      these organisms. Very few attempts have been made to characterize genetic 
      polymorphisms of parasites isolated from Panamanian patients of cutaneous 
      leishmaniasis. Here we present data on the genetic variability of local isolates of 
      Leishmania, as well as specimens from several other species, by means of Amplified 
      Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLP), a technique seldom used to study genetic 
      makeup of parasites. We demonstrate that this technique allows detection of very 
      high levels of genetic variability in local isolates of Leishmania panamensis in a 
      highly reproducible manner. The analysis of AFLP fingerprints generated by unique 
      selective primer combinations in L. panamensis suggests a predominant clonal mode of 
      reproduction. Using fluorescently labeled primers, many taxon-specific fragments 
      were identified which may show potential as species diagnostic fragments. The AFLP 
      permitted a high resolution genetic analysis of the Leishmania genus, clearly 
      separating certain groups among L. panamensis specimens and highly related species 
      such as L. panamensis and L. guyanensis. The phylogenetic networks reconstructed 
      from our AFLP data are congruent with established taxonomy for the genus Leishmania, 
      even when using single selective primer combinations. Results of this study 
      demonstrate that AFLP polymorphisms can be informative for genetic characterization 
      in Leishmania parasites, at both intra and inter-specific levels.

TI  - Are Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Playing a Role in the Parasite Control in Active 
      American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis Lesions?
PG  - e0133063
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0133063 [doi]
LID - e0133063
AB  - Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been described as a network of 
      extracellular fibers composed by DNA, histones and various proteins/enzymes. Studies 
      have demonstrated that NETs could be responsible for the trapping and elimination of 
      a variety of infectious agents. In order to verify the presence of NETs in American 
      tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) and their relationship with the presence of 
      amastigotes we evaluated active cutaneous lesions of 35 patients before treatment by 
      the detection of parasites, neutrophils (neutrophil elastase) and histones through 
      immunohistochemistry and confocal immunofluorescence. Intact neutrophils could be 
      detected in all ATL lesions. NETs were present in 27 patients (median 1.1; range 
      from 0.1 to 23.5/mm2) with lesion duration ranging from one to seven months. NETs 
      were in close proximity with neutrophils (r = 0.586; p = 0.0001) and amastigotes (r 
      = 0.710; p = 0.0001). Two patterns of NET formation were detected: small 
      homogeneously distributed networks observed in all lesions; and large structures 
      that could be visualized at a lower magnification in lesions presenting at least 20% 
      of neutrophils. Lesions presenting the larger NET formation showed high parasite 
      detection. A correlation between NET size and the number of intact amastigotes was 
      observed (p=0.02). As we detected an association between NET and amastigotes, our 
      results suggest that neutrophil migration and NET formation could be stimulated and 
      maintained by stimuli derived from the parasite burden/parasite antigen in the 
      extracellular environment. The observation of areas containing only antigens not 
      intermingled with NETs (elastase and histone) suggests that the involvement of these 
      structures in the control of parasite burden is a dynamic process in which the 
      formation of NETs is exhausted with the destruction of the parasites. Since NETs 
      were also associated with granulomas, this trapping would favor the activity of 
      macrophages in order to control the parasite burden.

TI  - Comparative analysis of the kinomes of three pathogenic trypanosomatids: Leishmania 
      major, Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi.
PG  - 127
AB  - BACKGROUND: The trypanosomatids Leishmania major, Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma 
      cruzi cause some of the most debilitating diseases of humankind: cutaneous 
      leishmaniasis, African sleeping sickness, and Chagas disease. These protozoa possess 
      complex life cycles that involve development in mammalian and insect hosts, and a 
      tightly coordinated cell cycle ensures propagation of the highly polarized cells. 
      However, the ways in which the parasites respond to their environment and coordinate 
      intracellular processes are poorly understood. As a part of an effort to understand 
      parasite signaling functions, we report the results of a genome-wide analysis of 
      protein kinases (PKs) of these three trypanosomatids. RESULTS: Bioinformatic 
      searches of the trypanosomatid genomes for eukaryotic PKs (ePKs) and atypical PKs 
      (aPKs) revealed a total of 176 PKs in T. brucei, 190 in T. cruzi and 199 in L. 
      major, most of which are orthologous across the three species. This is approximately 
      30% of the number in the human host and double that of the malaria parasite, 
      Plasmodium falciparum. The representation of various groups of ePKs differs 
      significantly as compared to humans: trypanosomatids lack receptor-linked tyrosine 
      and tyrosine kinase-like kinases, although they do possess dual-specificity kinases. 
      A relative expansion of the CMGC, STE and NEK groups has occurred. A large number of 
      unique ePKs show no strong affinity to any known group. The trypanosomatids possess 
      few ePKs with predicted transmembrane domains, suggesting that receptor ePKs are 
      rare. Accessory Pfam domains, which are frequently present in human ePKs, are 
      uncommon in trypanosomatid ePKs. CONCLUSION: Trypanosomatids possess a large set of 
      PKs, comprising approximately 2% of each genome, suggesting a key role for 
      phosphorylation in parasite biology. Whilst it was possible to place most of the 
      trypanosomatid ePKs into the seven established groups using bioinformatic analyses, 
      it has not been possible to ascribe function based solely on sequence similarity. 
      Hence the connection of stimuli to protein phosphorylation networks remains 
      enigmatic. The presence of numerous PKs with significant sequence similarity to 
      known drug targets, as well as a large number of unusual kinases that might 
      represent novel targets, strongly argue for functional analysis of these molecules.

AB  - Different Leishmania species cause distinct clinical manifestations of the 
      infectious disease leishmaniasis. It is fundamentally important to understand the 
      mechanisms governing the interaction between Leishmania and its host cell. Little is 
      known about this interaction between Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis and human 
      macrophages. In this study, we aimed to identify differential gene expression 
      between non-infected and L. (V) braziliensis-infected U937-derived macrophages. We 
      deployed a whole human transcriptome microarray analysis using 72 hours 
      post-infection samples and compared those samples with their non-infected 
      counterparts. We found that 218 genes were differentially expressed between infected 
      and non-infected macrophages. A total of 71.6% of these genes were down-regulated in 
      the infected macrophages. Functional enrichment analyses identified the steroid and 
      sterol/cholesterol biosynthetic processes between regulatory networks down-regulated 
      in infected macrophages. RT-qPCR further confirmed this down-regulation in genes 
      belonging to these pathways. These findings contrast with those from studies 
      involving other Leishmania species at earlier infection stages, where gene 
      up-regulation for this metabolic pathway has been reported. Sterol biosynthesis 
      could be an important biological process associated with the expression profile of 
      macrophages infected by L. (V.) braziliensis. Differential transcriptional results 
      suggest a negative regulation of the genetic regulatory network involved in 
      cholesterol biosynthesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: TH2-dependent diseases vary in severity according to genotype, but 
      relevant gene polymorphisms remain largely unknown. The integrin CD11a is a critical 
      determinant of allergic responses, and allelic variants of this gene might influence 
      allergic phenotypes. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine major CD11a allelic variants 
      in mice and human subjects and their importance to allergic disease expression. 
      METHODS: We sequenced mouse CD11a alleles from C57BL/6 and BALB/c strains to 
      identify major polymorphisms; human CD11a single nucleotide polymorphisms were 
      compared with allergic disease phenotypes as part of the international HapMap 
      project. Mice on a BALB/c or C57BL/6 background and congenic for the other strain's 
      CD11a allele were created to determine the importance of mouse CD11a polymorphisms 
      in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: Compared with the C57BL/6 allele, the BALB/c CD11a 
      allele contained a nonsynonymous change from asparagine to aspartic acid within the 
      metal ion binding domain. In general, the BALB/c CD11a allele enhanced and the 
      C57BL/6 CD11a allele suppressed TH2 cell-dependent disease caused by the parasite 
      Leishmania major and allergic lung disease caused by the fungus Aspergillus niger. 
      Relative to the C57BL/6 CD11a allele, the BALB/c CD11a allele conferred both greater 
      T-cell adhesion to CD54 in vitro and enhanced TH2 cell homing to lungs in vivo. We 
      further identified a human CD11a polymorphism that significantly associated with 
      atopic disease and relevant allergic indices. CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms in CD11a 
      critically influence TH2 cell homing and diverse TH2-dependent immunopathologic 
      states in mice and potentially influence the expression of human allergic disease.

TI  - Assessment of the role of small mammals in the transmission cycle of tegumentary 
      leishmaniasis and first report of natural infection with Leishmania braziliensis in 
      two sigmodontines in northeastern Argentina.
PG  - 405-412

AB  - To contribute to the knowledge of the role of small mammals in the transmission 
      cycle of tegumentary leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania braziliensis, we studied the 
      small mammal community and its temporal and spatial association with phlebotominae, 
      as well as small mammal infection by Leishmania spp. by PCR-RFLP analyses in an 
      endemic area of northeastern Argentina. Ten small mammal samplings were conducted 
      (2007-2009, 7506 Sherman trap nights and 422 cage trap nights). In two of these 
      samplings, 16 capture stations each one consisting of a CDC light trap to capture 
      phlebotominae, two to four Sherman traps and two cage traps were placed. We found 
      co-occurrence of phlebotominae and small mammal captures in four stations, which 
      were all the stations with small mammal captures and yielded 97% (2295 specimens, 
      including 21 gravid females) of the total phlebotominae captures, suggesting that 
      small mammals may provide a potential source of blood for phlebotominae females. One 
      Didelphis albiventris and two Rattus rattus were associated with high captures of 
      Nyssomyia whitmani, vector of L. braziliensis in the study area. The PCR-RFLP 
      analyses confirm the presence of L. braziliensis in two sigmodontine small mammals 
      (Akodon sp. and Euryoryzomys russatus) for the first time in Argentina, to our 
      knowledge.

TI  - Co-occurrence and seasonal and environmental distributions of the sandflies

      northeastern Argentina.
PG  - 197-205

AB  - The aim of this work was to study the distribution of Phlebotominae (Diptera: 
      Psycodidade) abundance in time and space in an area in northeastern Argentina with 
      vector transmission of visceral and tegumentary leishmaniasis. For this, 51 
      households were selected using a 'worst scenario' criterion where one light trap was 
      set during two consecutive nights in peridomiciles in the transitions between the 
      four seasons, and the environment was surveyed simultaneously. The relationships of 
      phlebotomine assemblage structure and the most abundant species with seasonality and 
      environmental variables were evaluated using a canonical correspondence analysis and 
      generalized linear mixed models, respectively. A total of 5110 individuals were 
      captured. Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz & Neiva, 1912) and Nyssomyia whitmani (Antunes 
      & Coutinho, 1939) were the most abundant species captured in all samplings (98.3% of 
      the total capture). The period of highest abundance of Lu. longipalpis was early 
      autumn, and it was distributed in the most urbanized areas. Nyssomyia whitmani 
      occupied mainly the less urbanized areas, showing peaks of abundance in early spring 
      and summer. Other species were captured in low numbers and showed seasonal-spatial 
      variations similar to those of Ny. whitmani. We confirmed Leishmania spp. vector 
      persistence throughout the year in spatial patches of high abundance even during the 
      less favorable season.

TI  - Quantitative Kinetoplast DNA Assessment During Treatment of Mucosal Leishmaniasis as 
      a Potential Biomarker of Outcome: A Pilot Study.
PG  - 107-13
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.15-0514 [doi]
AB  - Mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) is a disfiguring manifestation of Leishmania (Viannia) 
      infection. We evaluated parasite load (PL) over time as a potential biomarker of 
      treatment outcome in ML. PL was assessed with kinetoplast DNA quantitative real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction (kDNA-qPCR) at enrollment, days 14 and 21-28 of therapy 
      and 3, 6, 12-18, and 18-24 months after treatment of ML and correlated to 
      demographic, clinical, and parasitologic factors. Forty-four patients were enrolled: 
      30 men and 14 women. Enrollment PL differed significantly by causative species (P < 
      0.001), and was higher in patients with severe ML (nasal and laryngeal involvement) 
      compared with those with only isolated nasal involvement (median = 1,285 versus 51.5 
      parasites/μg tissue DNA; P = 0.005). Two patterns of PL emerged: pattern 1 (N = 23) 
      was characterized by a sequential decline in PL during and after therapy until kDNA 
      was undetectable. Pattern 2 (N = 18) was characterized by clearance of detectable 
      kDNA during treatment, followed by an increased PL thereafter. All patients who 
      failed treatment (N = 4) demonstrated pattern 1. Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis 
      was overrepresented among those with pattern 2 (P = 0.019). PL can be quantified by 
      cytology brush qPCR during and after treatment in ML. We demonstrate that treatment 
      failure was associated with undetectable PL, and L. (V.) braziliensis infection was 
      overrepresented in those with rebounding PL.

TI  - A putative ATP/GTP binding protein affects Leishmania mexicana growth in insect 
      vectors and vertebrate hosts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Leishmania virulence factors responsible for the complicated 
      epidemiology of the various leishmaniases remain mainly unidentified. This study is 
      a characterization of a gene previously identified as upregulated in two of three 
      overlapping datasets containing putative factors important for Leishmania's ability 
      to establish mammalian intracellular infection and to colonize the gut of an insect 
      vector. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The investigated gene encodes ATP/GTP 
      binding motif-containing protein related to Leishmania development 1 (ALD1), a 
      cytosolic protein that contains a cryptic ATP/GTP binding P-loop. We compared 
      differentiation, growth rates, and infective abilities of wild-type and ALD1 null 
      mutant cell lines of L. mexicana. Loss of ALD1 results in retarded growth kinetics 
      but not defects in differentiation in axenic culture. Similarly, when mice and the 
      sand fly vector were infected with the ALD1 null mutant, the primary difference in 
      infection and colonization phenotype relative to wild type was an inability to 
      achieve maximal host pathogenicity. While ability of the ALD1 null mutant cells to 
      infect macrophages in vitro was not affected, replication within macrophages was 
      clearly curtailed. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: L. mexicana ALD1, encoding a protein 
      with no assigned functional domains or motifs, was identified utilizing multiple 
      comparative analyses with the related and often experimentally overlooked monoxenous 
      flagellates. We found that it plays a role in Leishmania infection and colonization 
      in vitro and in vivo. Results suggest that ALD1 functions in L. mexicana's general 
      metabolic network, rather than function in specific aspect of virulence as 
      anticipated from the compared datasets. This result validates our comparative 
      genomics approach for finding relevant factors, yet highlights the importance of 
      quality laboratory-based analysis of genes tagged by these methods.

AB  - The aims of the study were to (a) investigate the effect of trapping methods on 
      alpha diversity; and (b) enhance the knowledge of the sandfly assemblage in the 
      state of Quintana Roo. Field work was undertaken in a tropical forest of southern 
      Mexico from August 2013 to July 2014. Sampling was conducted monthly during three 
      consecutive nights. For each trapping night, 12 different types of trap were 
      operated from 18.00 to 24.00 hours in four transects. Measures of alpha community 
      diversity were based on the quantification of the number of species (Chao 2, 
      Jackknife 2, Clench's equation, Margalef's index) and the community structure, as 
      well as the dominance (Simpson and Berger-Parker indexes) and evenness (Shannon's 
      entropy index, true diversity of the Jost and Pielou index). With a total sampling 
      effort of 1728 night-traps, 16 101 phlebotomine sandflies were collected; they 
      represented two genera and 13 species. Diversity estimates of 100% (Chao 2 and 
      Clench's equation) and 85% (Jackknife 2) of potential species in the study area were 
      calculated. Shannon traps and CDC light traps indicated the largest number of 
      species, but only Shannon traps showed the greatest abundance. This inventory of 
      sandflies is an important activity to enhance our knowledge of sandfly assemblages 
      and guilds. The ultimate goal of studying alpha diversity in sandflies would be to 
      have a better understanding of the population dynamics and all complex networks of 
      interactions that may, in turn, be associated with the epidemiology of the disease.

TI  - Metabolic network analysis predicts efficacy of FDA-approved drugs targeting the 
      causative agent of a neglected tropical disease.
PG  - 27
LID - 10.1186/1752-0509-6-27 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systems biology holds promise as a new approach to drug target 
      identification and drug discovery against neglected tropical diseases. Genome-scale 
      metabolic reconstructions, assembled from annotated genomes and a vast array of 
      bioinformatics/biochemical resources, provide a framework for the interrogation of 
      human pathogens and serve as a platform for generation of future experimental 
      hypotheses. In this article, with the application of selection criteria for both 
      Leishmania major targets (e.g. in silico gene lethality) and drugs (e.g. toxicity), 
      a method (MetDP) to rationally focus on a subset of low-toxic Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA)-approved drugs is introduced. RESULTS: This metabolic 
      network-driven approach identified 15 L. major genes as high-priority targets, 8 
      high-priority synthetic lethal targets, and 254 FDA-approved drugs. Results were 
      compared to previous literature findings and existing high-throughput screens. 
      Halofantrine, an antimalarial agent that was prioritized using MetDP, showed 
      noticeable antileishmanial activity when experimentally evaluated in vitro against 
      L. major promastigotes. Furthermore, synthetic lethality predictions also aided in 
      the prediction of superadditive drug combinations. For proof-of-concept, double-drug 
      combinations were evaluated in vitro against L. major and four combinations 
      involving the drug disulfiram that showed superadditivity are presented. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A direct metabolic network-driven method that incorporates single gene 
      essentiality and synthetic lethality predictions is proposed that generates a set of 
      high-priority L. major targets, which are in turn associated with a select number of 
      FDA-approved drugs that are candidate antileishmanials. Additionally, selection of 
      high-priority double-drug combinations might provide for an attractive and 
      alternative avenue for drug discovery against leishmaniasis.

TI  - Down-regulation of dendritic cell signaling pathways by Leishmania amazonensis 
      amastigotes.
PG  - 3371-82
LID - 10.1016/j.molimm.2008.04.018 [doi]
AB  - We have previously reported a link between a deficient Th1 response to Leishmania 
      amazonensis (La) parasites and profound impairments in the cytokine/chemokine 
      network at early stages of the infection. To define the molecular basis of these 
      deficiencies, we focused on early and intracellular events in La-infected dendritic 
      cells (DCs) in this study. La amastigote-infected DCs were less mature and less 
      potent antigen-presenting cells (APC) than their promastigote-infected counterparts, 
      as judged by the lower expression of CD40 and CD83, suppressed cytokine expression 
      (IL-12p40 and IL-10), reduced effectiveness for priming CD4+ T cells from naïve or 
      infected mice. Infection with La promastigotes, but not amastigotes, triggered 
      transient expression of IL-12p40 by DC. Both forms of parasites markedly suppressed 
      IL-12p40, IL-12p70, and IL-6 production and increased IL-10 production when DCs were 
      treated with LPS, IFN-gamma/LPS or IFN-alpha/LPS as positive stimuli. Of note, 
      pre-infection of DCs with live amastigotes resulted in multiple alterations in 
      innate signaling pathways, including degradation of STAT2, decreased phosphorylation 
      of STAT1, 2, 3 and ERK1/2, and markedly reduced expression of interferon regulatory 
      factor-1 (IRF-1) and IRF-8, some of which were partially reversed by pretreatment of 
      parasites with proteasome or protease inhibitors. The impaired IL-12 production in 
      infected DCs was not attributed to increased IL-10 production. Together, our data 
      suggest that La parasites, especially in their intracellular forms, have evolved 
      unique strategies to actively down-regulate early innate signaling events, resulting 
      in impaired DC function and Th1 activation.

PG  - 330
LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-10-330 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Europeans represent the majority of international travellers and 
      clinicians encountering returned patients have an essential role in recognizing, and 
      communicating travel-associated public health risks. METHODS: To investigate the 
      morbidity of travel associated infectious diseases in European travellers, we 
      analysed diagnoses with demographic, clinical and travel-related predictors of 
      disease, in 6957 ill returned travellers who presented in 2008 to EuroTravNet 
      centres with a presumed travel associated condition. RESULTS: Gastro-intestinal (GI) 
      diseases accounted for 33% of illnesses, followed by febrile systemic illnesses 
      (20%), dermatological conditions (12%) and respiratory illnesses (8%). There were 3 
      deaths recorded; a sepsis caused by Escherichia coli pyelonephritis, a dengue shock 
      syndrome and a Plasmodium falciparum malaria.GI conditions included bacterial acute 
      diarrhea (6.9%), as well as giardiasis and amebasis (2.3%). Among febrile systemic 
      illnesses with identified pathogens, malaria (5.4%) accounted for most cases 
      followed by dengue (1.9%) and others including chikungunya, rickettsial diseases, 
      leptospirosis, brucellosis, Epstein Barr virus infections, tick-borne encephalitis 
      (TBE) and viral hepatitis. Dermatological conditions were dominated by bacterial 
      infections, arthropod bites, cutaneous larva migrans and animal bites requiring 
      rabies post-exposure prophylaxis and also leishmaniasis, myasis, tungiasis and one 
      case of leprosy. Respiratory illness included 112 cases of tuberculosis including 
      cases of multi-drug resistant or extensively drug resistant tuberculosis, 104 cases 
      of influenza like illness, and 5 cases of Legionnaires disease. Sexually transmitted 
      infections (STI) accounted for 0.6% of total diagnoses and included HIV infection 
      and syphilis. A total of 165 cases of potentially vaccine preventable diseases were 
      reported. Purpose of travel and destination specific risk factors was identified for 
      several diagnoses such as Chagas disease in immigrant travellers from South America 
      and P. falciparum malaria in immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa. Travel within 
      Europe was also associated with health risks with distinctive profiles for Eastern 
      and Western Europe. CONCLUSIONS: In 2008, a broad spectrum of travel associated 
      diseases were diagnosed at EuroTravNet core sites. Diagnoses varied according to 
      regions visited by ill travellers. The spectrum of travel associated morbidity also 
      shows that there is a need to dispel the misconception that travel, close to home, 
      in Europe, is without significant health risk.

TI  - Ultrastructural features of the midgut epithelium of females Lutzomyia intermedia 
      (Lutz & Neiva, 1912) (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae).
PG  - 1141-51
AB  - A morphological study of the midgut of Lutzomyia intermedia, the primary vector of 
      cutaneous leishmaniasis, in southeast Brazil, was conducted by light, scanning and 
      transmission electron microscopy. The midgut is formed by a layer of epithelium of 
      columnar cells on a non-cellular basal lamina, under which there is a musculature, 
      which consists of circular and longitudinal muscular fibers. A tracheolar network is 
      observed surrounding and penetrating in the musculature. Females were examined 12, 
      24, 48, 72 h and 5 days following a blood meal and were analyzed comparatively by 
      transmission electron microscopy with starved females. In starved females, the 
      epithelium of both the anterior and posterior sections of the midgut present whorl 
      shaped rough endoplasmic reticulum. The posterior section does not present 
      well-developed cellular structures such as mitochondria. Observations performed at 
      12, 24, 48 and 72 h after the blood meal showed morphological changes in the 
      cellular structures in this section, and the presence of the peritrophic matrix up 
      to 48 h after the blood meal. Digestion is almost complete and a few residues are 
      detected in the lumen 72 h after blood feeding. Finally, on the 5th day after the 
      blood meal all cellular structures present the original feature resembling that seen 
      in starved sand flies. Morphometric data confirmed the morphological observations. 
      Mitochondria, nuclei and microvilli of midgut epithelial cells are different in 
      starved and blood fed females. The mitochondria present a similar profile in the 
      epithelium of both the anterior and posterior section of the midgut, with higher 
      dimension in starved females. The cell microvilli in the posterior section of the 
      midgut of starved females are twice the size of those that had taken a blood meal. 
      We concluded that there are changes in the midgut cellular structures of L. 
      intermedia during the digestion of blood, which are in agreement with those 
      described for other hematophagous diptera.

TI  - Natural killer cell behavior in lymph nodes revealed by static and real-time 
      imaging.
PG  - 619-31
AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells promote dendritic cell (DC) maturation and influence T 
      cell differentiation in vitro. To better understand the nature of the putative 
      interactions among these cells in vivo during the early phases of an adaptive immune 
      response, we have used immunohistochemical analysis and dynamic intravital imaging 
      to study NK cell localization and behavior in lymph nodes (LNs) in the steady state 
      and shortly after infection with Leishmania major. In the LNs of naive mice, NK 
      cells reside in the medulla and the paracortex, where they closely associate with 
      DCs. In contrast to T cells, intravital microscopy revealed that NK cells in the 
      superficial regions of LNs were slowly motile and maintained their interactions with 
      DCs over extended times in the presence or absence of immune-activating signals. L. 
      major induced NK cells to secrete interferon-gamma and to be recruited to the 
      paracortex, where concomitant CD4 T cell activation occurred. Therefore, NK cells 
      form a reactive but low mobile network in a strategic area of the LN where they can 
      receive inflammatory signals, interact with DCs, and regulate colocalized T cell 
      responses.

TI  - De novo assembly and sex-specific transcriptome profiling in the sand fly 
      Phlebotomus perniciosus (Diptera, Phlebotominae), a major Old World vector of 
      Leishmania infantum.
PG  - 847

AB  - BACKGROUND: The phlebotomine sand fly Phlebotomus perniciosus (Diptera: Psychodidae, 
      Phlebotominae) is a major Old World vector of the protozoan Leishmania infantum, the 
      etiological agent of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniases in humans and dogs, a 
      worldwide re-emerging diseases of great public health concern, affecting 101 
      countries. Despite the growing interest in the study of this sand fly species in the 
      last years, the development of genomic resources has been limited so far. To 
      increase the available sequence data for P. perniciosus and to start studying the 
      molecular basis of the sexual differentiation in sand flies, we performed whole 
      transcriptome Illumina RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of adult males and females and de 
      novo transcriptome assembly. RESULTS: We assembled 55,393 high quality transcripts, 
      of which 29,292 were unique, starting from adult whole body male and female pools. 
      11,736 transcripts had at least one functional annotation, including full-length low 
      abundance salivary transcripts, 981 transcripts were classified as putative long 
      non-coding RNAs and 244 transcripts encoded for putative novel proteins specific of 
      the Phlebotominae sub-family. Differential expression analysis identified 8590 
      transcripts significantly biased between sexes. Among them, some show relaxation of 
      selective constraints when compared to their orthologs of the New World sand fly 
      species Lutzomyia longipalpis. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we present a 
      comprehensive transcriptome resource for the sand fly species P. perniciosus built 
      from short-read RNA-seq and we provide insights into sex-specific gene expression at 
      adult stage. Our analysis represents a first step towards the identification of 
      sex-specific genes and pathways and a foundation for forthcoming investigations into 
      this important vector species, including the study of the evolution of sex-biased 
      genes and of the sexual differentiation in phlebotomine sand flies.

TI  - The malnutrition-related increase in early visceralization of Leishmania donovani is 
      associated with a reduced number of lymph node phagocytes and altered conduit system 
      flow.
PG  - e2329

AB  - In a murine model of moderate childhood malnutrition we found that polynutrient 
      deficiency led to a 4-5-fold increase in early visceralization of L. donovani (3 
      days post-infection) following cutaneous infection and a 16-fold decrease in lymph 
      node barrier function (p<0.04 for all). To begin to understand the mechanistic basis 
      for this malnutrition-related parasite dissemination we analyzed the cellularity, 
      architecture, and function of the skin-draining lymph node. There was no difference 
      in the localization of multiple cell populations in the lymph node of polynutrient 
      deficient (PND) mice, but there was reduced cellularity with fewer CD11c(+)dendritic 
      cells (DCs), fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs), MOMA-2(+) macrophages, and 
      CD169(+) subcapsular sinus macrophage (p<0.05 for all) compared to the 
      well-nourished (WN) mice. The parasites were equally co-localized with DCs 
      associated with the lymph node conduit network in the WN and PND mice, and were 
      found in the high endothelial venule into which the conduits drain. When a 
      fluorescent low molecular weight (10 kD) dextran was delivered in the skin, there 
      was greater efflux of the marker from the lymph node conduit system to the spleens 
      of PND mice (p<0.04), indicating that flow through the conduit system was altered. 
      There was no evidence of disruption of the conduit or subcapsular sinus 
      architecture, indicating that the movement of parasites into the subcortical conduit 
      region was due to an active process and not from passive movement through a leaking 
      barrier. These results indicate that the impaired capacity of the lymph node to act 
      as a barrier to dissemination of L. donovani infection is associated with a reduced 
      number of lymph node phagocytes, which most likely leads to reduced capture of 
      parasites as they transit through the sinuses and conduit system.

TI  - Diagnosis of Leishmania using the polymerase chain reaction: a simplified procedure 
      for field work.
PG  - 348-56
AB  - Oligonucleotide primers directed to the minicircle kinetoplast DNA of Leishmania 
      strains supported enzymatic amplification of this DNA by the polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR). A single product of 70 basepairs was obtained from parasites 
      belonging exclusively to the L. braziliensis complex. Direct sequencing of the 
      amplified product confirmed its minicircle origin. Skin biopsy specimens from human 
      patients were used directly for the PCR. A pulse incubation of such specimens with 
      deoxyribonuclease I prior to the PCR increased the reliability of the assay. 
      Nuclease disruption of the kinetoplast network was expected to make more copies of 
      the minicircle accessible to amplification. Comparative results between the PCR and 
      conventional parasitologic detection procedures indicate that the DNA detection 
      approach presented is by far more sensitive for diagnostic purposes. Innovations in 
      the PCR protocol are presented that adapt the diagnosis of leishmaniasis to settings 
      with minimal equipment and that are distant from central laboratories.

AB  - The low dispersal capacity of sand flies could lead to population isolation due to 
      geographic barriers, climate variation, or to population fragmentation associated 
      with specific local habitats due to landscape modification. The phlebotomine sand 
      fly Lutzomyia cruciata has a wide distribution throughout Mexico and is a vector of 
      Leishmania mexicana in the southeast. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
      genetic diversity, structure, and divergence within and among populations of Lu. 
      cruciata in the state of Chiapas, and to infer the intra-specific phylogeny using 
      the 3' end of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. We analyzed 62 sequences from 
      four Lu. cruciata populations and found 26 haplotypes, high genetic differentiation 
      and restricted gene flow among populations (Fst=0.416, Nm=0.701, p<0.001). The 
      highest diversity values were recorded in populations from Loma Bonita and Guadalupe 
      Miramar. Three lineages (100% bootstrap and 7% overall divergence) were identified 
      using a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis which showed high genetic 
      divergence (17.2-22.7%). A minimum spanning haplotype network also supported 
      separation into three lineages. Genetic structure and divergence within and among 
      Lu. cruciata populations are hence affected by geographic heterogeneity and 
      evolutionary background. Data obtained in the present study suggest that Lu. 
      cruciata in the state of Chiapas consists of at least three lineages. Such findings 
      may have implications for vector capacity and hence for vector control strategies.

TI  - Lymph node resident rather than skin-derived dendritic cells initiate specific T 
      cell responses after Leishmania major infection.
PG  - 1250-6
AB  - Langerhans cells have been thought to play a major role as APCs for induction of 
      specific immune responses to Leishmania major. Although their requirement for 
      control of infection has been challenged recently, it remains unclear whether they 
      can transport Ag to lymph nodes and promote initiation of T cell responses. 
      Moreover, the role of dermal dendritic cells (DCs), another population of skin DCs, 
      has so far not been addressed. We have investigated the origin and characterized the 
      cell population responsible for initial activation of L. major-specific T cells in 
      susceptible and resistant mice. We found that Ag presentation in draining lymph 
      nodes peaks as early as 24 h after infection and is mainly mediated by a population 
      of CD11c(high)CD11b(high)Gr-1-CD8-langerin- DCs residing in lymph nodes and 
      acquiring soluble Ags possibly drained through the conduit network. In contrast, 
      skin-derived DCs, including Langerhans cells and dermal DCs, migrated poorly to 
      lymph nodes and played a minor role in early T cell activation. Furthermore, 
      prevention of migration through early removal of the infection site did not affect 
      Ag presentation by CD11c(high) CD11b(high) DCs and activation of Leishmania 
      major-specific naive CD4+ T cells in vivo.

TI  - Depletion of peritoneal CD5+ B cells has no effect on the course of Leishmania major 
      infection in susceptible and resistant mice.
PG  - 123-9
AB  - The mouse peritoneal cavity contains a unique self-renewing population of B cells 
      (B-1) derived from fetal liver precursors and mainly producing polyreactive 
      antibodies. Since B-1 cells are a potential source of IL-10, it has been suggested 
      that these cells may contribute to the susceptibility of BALB/c mice to Leishmania 
      major infection by skewing the T helper cell network towards a Th2 phenotype. 
      Accordingly, L. major infection of B cell-defective BALB/c Xid mice (lacking B-1 
      cells) induces less severe disease compared with controls. However, in addition to 
      the lack of B-1 cells, the Xid immune deficiency is characterized by high endogenous 
      interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production. In the present study, the role of B-1 cells 
      during L. major infection was investigated in mice experimentally depleted of 
      peritoneal B-1 cells. Six weeks old C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mice were lethally irradiated 
      and reconstituted with autologous bone marrow which allows systemic depletion of B-1 
      cells. Untreated BALB/c, C57Bl/6 as well as BALB/c Xid mice were used as controls. 
      After reconstitution, mice were injected with L. major amastigotes and progression 
      was followed using clinical, parasitological and immunological criteria. As 
      previously reported, BALB/c Xid mice showed a significant reduction in disease 
      progression. In contrast, despite the dramatic reduction of B-1 cells, B-1-depleted 
      BALB/c mice showed similar or even worse disease progression compared with control 
      BALB/c mice. No differences were found between B-1-depleted or control C57Bl/6 mice. 
      Our data suggest that the B-1 cells do not contribute to the susceptibility of 
      BALB/c mice to L. major infection.
